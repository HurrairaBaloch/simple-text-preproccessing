       "0     An interesting historic area best enjoyed with a guide although a sparse few information boards in English and Urdu are present in some areas. As with most tourist sites in Lahore, foreigners cost 500 per person, children (under 10?) free. This site is made more interesting for the children by the addition of costumed actors in various parts of the fort. The highlight was definitely the building of mirrors - which sparkled like stars when you shone a (phone) light at the ceiling - spectacular and well worth paying the extra 100 pkr to see!  Toilets on site and lots of space for kids to run around.   \n",
       "1     It is a good place to visit especially if there is interest in history and learning about one's culture. The renovations done however are not complete and there are some areas still closed off to the public. If promoted well and rightly then these places are a very good tourist attraction and can generate significant income.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
