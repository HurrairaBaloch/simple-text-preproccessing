"An interesting historic area best enjoyed with a guide although a sparse few information boards in English and Urdu are present in some areas. As with most tourist sites in Lahore, foreigners cost 500 per person, children (under 10?) free. This site is made more interesting for the children by the addition of costumed actors in various parts of the fort. The highlight was definitely the building of mirrors - which sparkled like stars when you shone a (phone) light at the ceiling - spectacular and well worth paying the extra 100 pkr to see!  Toilets on site and lots of space for kids to run around."
It is a good place to visit especially if there is interest in history and learning about one's culture. The renovations done however are not complete and there are some areas still closed off to the public. If promoted well and rightly then these places are a very good tourist attraction and can generate significant income.
Lahore fort built in 17nth century.  Worth to visit and be amazed what's inside. Well maintained and cleaned . They have a mini bus to ride or you can just go by walk. We hired a tourist  guide for us to understand more and he is well knowledgeas expected‚ò∫Ô∏è. It is one  of the most historical place in Pakistan.

"It is such a glamorous place. Do not miss out on it when visiting Lahore, as these walls truly preserved the vibe of a bygone era. We spent about 2.5 hours inside, but we would have gladly spent even more time here. The architecture is phemonal."
"17th Century Marvel that was re built in that time. Very beautiful fortress and gates worth looking at. Spread over a large area. Has around 21 monuments. Alternate name would be Badshahi Masjid or Mosque. Prayers Marriages Tourism all combined, many restaurants to chose from. A tour is usually arranged where people go in as groups with their respective guides."

"Lahore Fort is the most mesmerising Mughal time fort which is recently restored by the WCLA.

"Lahore Fort/Shahi Qilla, the most historical place in Pakistan, built in 17th century.

You can take mini bus to ride or you can just go by walk. Ticket price is reasonable. Some of its area is abandoned, some of its area requires renovation but rest is just awesome. You will feel how Kings were living inside fort & dealing with matters of state. It was a great experience to be part of this magical place. Hope to visit againüôÇ Recommended"
Newly restored. The Iconic Alamgiri Gate is open for public now. The biggest picture wall is fully restored now. Huge place. Must visit for history enthusiasts.
"Best place to visit to learn about the cultural heritage and the history of muslims. With passing time, alot of ammendants have also been made for the ease of public visiting the place. Also, the environment is much safer now than before."
I have visited the Lahore Fort on both of my visits to Pakistan. It is a beautiful experience and well worth it for all tourists. You need a few hours to truly take it all in.
"Early history of the Fort is shrouded in mystery and nothing definite is known about it. Traditionally it is stated that the Fort was built as early as the city itself and its foundation is attributed to mythic Loh a son of the hero of Ramayana of Legendary age (1200-800 B.C).

The authentic mention of the Fort is found in connection with Muhammad Son's invasion of Lahore in 1180 A.D and was rebuilt by Emperor Balban in 1267 A.D. In the present shape, it was built by Akbar third Mughal Emperor in 1566 A.D. who removed its mud construction, used burnt brick masonry and enlarged it as well.

To determine its origin, excavations were carried out in the Fort by the Department of Archaeology, in the open lawn in front of Diwan-i-Am in 1959. A trench measuring 180 by 60 feet¬† laid and the digging executed down to a depth of 50 feet reaching to the virgine soil.¬† As a result twenty stratified cultural layers were encountered from top to bottom formed four distinct periods, British and Sikh, Mughal , Pre-Mughal and the pre-Muslim.

Lahore fort is the only place in Pakistan which represents the different phases in the development of Mughal architecture. It achieved prominence during the reign of Emperor Akbar. Afterwards his successors, Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb added numerous new buildings.

The Fort is situated in the north west corner of the city. It is irregular in plan being about 500 yards east to west by some 400 yards north to south. It is girdled round by a fortification wall constructed in small brunt brick having considerable strength. At intervals the wall has bastions and holes for musketry.

The important buildings of the fort are Dault Khana-e-Khas-o-Am, Sleeping Chamber of Emperor Jahangir, Shish Mahal, Diwan-e-Am, Diwan-e-Khas, Moti Masjid, Alamgiri Gate, etc."
"The monument takes us back to history, graceful and mesmerizing indeed. History lovers must visit the place, it is surrounded by other historical places like Minar e Pakistan, Badshahi Masjid, Sikh temple and Walled City of Lahore.
The Lahore Fort is one of the noblest structures of its kind in the world. Rising out of the northwest corner of the walled city, it has been a symbol of its earliest days. If it could speak, it would tell such things that would leave the listener breathless. It could tell of love, romance and adventure, of dark eyed beauties and fierce-browed warriors, of queens in flowing silks and kings in shining armour, of poets, actors, slaves and concubines, of soldiers and rebels, of revolutions and court intrigues, of coronations and assassinations, of treachery and black revenge.

The Lahore fort, also known as SHAHI QILA, is a reflection of many centuries. The earliest reference to the fort comes in a history of Lahur (Lahore) compiled by Al-Biruni, which refers to a fort constructed in the early 11th century. He further notes that Munshi Sujan Rae Bhandari, author of the Khulasatut Tawarikh in 1695-96 A.D., records that Malik Ayaz, a favorite of Sultan Mahmud, built a masonry fort at Lahore and repopulated the city. Khan believes it is the same fort that was destroyed by the Mongols in 1241 and in 1398 by a detachment of Timur‚Äôs army after which it was rebuilt again in 1421 by Sayyid, son of Khizr Khan.

Mughal emperor Akbar the great, demolished the earlier mud fort, and re-built it in burnt brick in 1566. Akbar‚Äôs successors, Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb added several buildings to the fort.

Lahore fort¬†is located in north-western corner of the walled city of Lahore. Though irregular in scheme the fort measures about 427 meters east-west and 335 meters north-south excluding the fortification wall added later during the Sikh rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1799 ‚Äì 1839 A.D). It is enclosed within a strong fortification wall, built in small burnt bricks. The main gates are located in the middle of the east and the west walls. A gateway, providing access to the private apartment of the royalty, exist in the northwest corner. The fort was essentially a fortress-palace, but it also, served as an abode for royal treasury, and a stronghold in the event of war."
"Very beautiful place for visit with friends and family. Ticket price of entrance is 50Rs and for shesh mehal is 100Rs.
Entrance is very difficult from main gate with DSLR camera üì∑. Tip for Entrance give your camera bag to your female friend or female family member.

"Historical Landmark, Lahore Fort is very large and beautiful place for visit. On your visit you can analyse the life style of Mughal Rulers. If you don't know much about the Lahore Fort recommended to take the guide for Rs: 100-200 they will guide you better. Further beware from. Scammers their is no further charges in Fort.
By visiting Lahore Fort you can have know the place, rooms, Halls, swimming pools for Kings and Queen. Also they have a inside mesum which is worthy on which visitors can view the Swords ‚öî arrow, and other arm things who h were used by them to fought against their enemy."
"We have done history by night tour of lahore fort twice. This is organized by Walled city authority.

It happens daily at 1930 hrs for approx 2 hours. It is a guided tour conducted by assigned tourguide.

The lighting of the whole fort is fabulous. It incldes showing all interesting sites including Allama iqbal‚Äôs tomb, the garden, baradari, sheesh mahal, barood khaana, shahi kitchen, etc.
Enough time is given to look around and take pics, etc. the souvenier shops are nice inside-value for money.
The whole tour was only for Rs 1500 per person.
This also include 1 classical music and dance performance, one dhol performance and a small plate of few local bites plus open top rickshaw rides twice.

It is comparable to roman colloseum guided tour or vatican city guided tour but much cheaper!

I recommend this for oct/ nov and feb/ march when fog is minimum.

For booking look for ‚ÄòHistory by nigh tour‚Äô by walled city Lahore on the net and call them to reserve your place.
You can pay on arrival.

Parking outside food street is tricky.
Entrance is at the end of food street.

We enjoyed it thoroughly.

Avoid the food at Haveli, view is good but food and service is below average."

It is the heritage of Mughal era from 17th centaury and remained under Sikhs and east india company as well, it has spreads over a large area. It also includes Shaesh mahal , Naulakha pavilion, Shahburj, katab khana and much more. During Sikh's regime they have built a Gurdwara too in it."
"It's really amazing site to visit. But most part of this fort is in process or renovation and repairing, so you can't able to enjoy real ancient feelings. I think no any fort guides are available on site. This is a stunningly gorgeous and historically significant location. People who are interested in history should go there and take in the sights. The most magical destination in the world to see the best Mughal Empire architecture."
"Great example of Mughal era buildings and gardens.
Huge site with many different buildings and gardens.
Minimum of an hour needed to walk around the site.
Guides and tour bus available at extra cost.
A lot of walking, so be mindful of the heat during midday."
Not much of a special place. The information desk rip off oversea visitors by charging more than double rates without reason. Most of the fort is closed off for repairs and development. Gift shops on site.
600 years old üóùÔ∏è fort it's located in Lahore Punjab Pakistan Known as the Mughal Emperors.The Beauty of Lahore
Grandeur at its peak. One really impressed with architecture. Touring guide are available but information is everywhere. Sheesh Mahal is under construction now. Must tour spot

"Feeling so good to visit this magical place.who is found of history , should be visit this great place.i just love with it.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"The Fort of Lahore.
The Lahore Fort has withstood over 500 years and still when you look at it, not much has changed. Many things have gone under renovation but this beautiful piece of architecture is just amazing. The it was designed and the thought that how it would have been constructed, raise goosebumps. A must visit place to view the glorious Muslim Reign.
History:
The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century, when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendor and opulence.
Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia, the first record of a fortified structure at the site was in regard to an 11th-century mud-brick fort. The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs. Additions from the Shah Jahan period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs, while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors, Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned Badshahi Mosque."
A very mesmerizing place must visit when you travel to lahore.
"These pictures show the side walls of the Lahore Fort. One such wall has been renovated and further renovation work is going on on the rest of the walls.
Plus: some other pictures."
Best historical place that i have visited. Most beautiful part was listening Magrib Azan while standing near Weapon house.
"Car parking is at entrance no.5.
From there, vehicles are available for pick & drop to Lahore Fort gate, by charging fee. This is recommended option. Otherwise, it will be difficult for families to walk a long distance.
On entrance of Fort, there are Guides available, who charge fee. They will quickly take one to all the renowned places inside the Fort within half an hour."
It is worth seeing place of Mughal era. You have to buy ticket of Rs. 50 to enter. There is concession for educational institutions trips. You are also hire electric cart and guide to visit the fort. Its very unfortunate that this historical place is badly neglected and not properly maintained.
Excellent place to visit historical sites.
"I had a great experience at the Lahore Fort. We had a good guide who explained to us in lots of detail all of the parts of the Lahore Fort for example the royal bedrooms etc. If you want to see Lahore for its old buildings and for its history, then this is definitely the place to go. It is a secure place and it has buggies that you can sit in instead of walking around the Lahore Fort because it is quite big (approx 1-2 hrs by buggy with the tour guide)."
"Good to see relative cleanliness. Sad to see VIP culture where only people with ""connections"" can visit choice places. Cars with green plates parked right inside the Badshahi Mosque and Lahore fort where common people have to pay just to walk in. Guess we are still in the Mughal era ü§™"
"ƒ∞f you want to visit this place completely you have to spend a whole day because it's huge.

Yes you have to buy ticket to enter and its price is different for Pakistanis and foreigner.

You can also use shutter service to go at the center of the fort.

Shish Mehal is beautiful part of the fort.

You can also go underground for cave visit but they only allow if you go with tour guide otherwise you are not allowed to enter in cave section."
"It's really amazing site to visit. But most part of this fort is in process or renovation ans repairing, so you can't able to enjoy real ancient feelings. I think no any fort guides are available on site.."
Best place and old mounoments are here that fascinating your mind and knowledge
Good place for visit .....make a trip earlier
"One of the greatest place to take your kids to. This is one place where you can visit multiple great places like Minar E Pakistan, Mazar E Iqbal, Lahore Fort, Baad Shahi Mosque and Daata sb Darbar.

It was on first trip to this historical place with family. And we all enjoyed a lot."
Historical place one of most beautiful places i have ever seen amazing work of art. Must visit place for families and people who like and art and history.
"I wish government of Pakistan had work on the preservation of more than it's needed now. Indeed, it's a place to be proud of our culture and history. I look forward to the future where government of Punjab takes serious actions to make it a more sophisticated and 24/7 open tourist point."
"Visiting this place made me both happy and sad. This country has given us so much but we? Nothing. Lahore Fort for example. A great heritage of the mughal empire, an ancient piece of beautiful and elegant architecture.
This place is worth a full-day tour. You can find cars to take you to Minar-e-Pakistan, Badshahi masjid, Lahore Fort and Mazar-e-Allama Iqbal.
As all kf you may know, it's the responsibility of the authorities as well as the local people to preserve its heritage sites, something which has clearly not been fulfilled here.
You'll find trash in places trash should not be. In the patches on the wall, the gardens, even in the basements, man you name it!
Moreover, people also find it very 'fun' to walk in dried swimming pools and play with fountains.
Thank god the Mughals made sure everything was well-built otherwise it would all have been crumbled down a long time ago."
"gorgeous structures with rich history. if you're a pakistani make sure to carry proof, the tickets are 500 for foreigners and 50 for pakistanis. the road to reach there however was very congested and difficult to drive through. whether you find it boring or not depends on you and your interest in the history of pakistan."
"Very great experience
Beautiful place to visit"

One of the main attractions of walled city of  lahore. Although it's been poorly maintained now by city admin. But still a great historical place and a must see place.
"They have now merged Badshahi Masjid, Shahi  Qila, Minar e Pakistan and surrounding area into a single boundary and renamed as Greater Iqbal Park. Significant improvements have been made over past few years and now this historical place has become more attractive and eye catching. If you are visiting Lahore, it is a must visit place. This entire place has been declared free breath zone and smoking is prohibited inside Greater Iqbal Park. Beauty of this place can't be described in words and snaps as well, you must visit here if you love greenery and moments."
"Haveli restaurant is placed on a very popular and picturesque point.that is, besides badshahi mosque.view is beautiful to be enjoyed and so favourite for selfies.
Food should be rated 8/10
Ambience good.
live singing just average

Overall experience is great to visit."
"Lahore Fort well known as the ‚ÄúShahi Qilla‚Äù is a wonderful and unique fort in its category which was the living place of many emperors, prince and princess.

Recently Lahore Fort is added into the UNESCO World Heritage Site. There is no certainty about the information that who built the Lahore Fort but the archeologist‚Äôs research shows that this fort was constructed before 1025 AD. This historical monument is an amazing and antique sample of Mughal architecture work. Lahore City is famous because of its gorgeous attractions and ravishing historical monuments and alot of people Fly to Lahore from far off cities and places to watch these attractions.

By most of the people the fort is associated with the great Mughal Emperor Akbar. After the period of Badshah Akbar, there many changings and up gradations were made inside the fort. From 1799 to 1849, Lahore Fort remain in hands of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

Lahore Fort is present on the entrance of the city with other standing landmarks of Badshahi Masjid (Mosque) and Minar-e-Pakistan. Visiting to Shahi Qilla gives the true meaning of life style of the great Mughal Emperors. There are two massive gates of the Lahore Fort. Alamgiri Gate opens towards the Badshahi Mosque and builds by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. This gate now a day is used as the main gate of the fort whereas the Masti Gate is closed. There is big hall with the name of Diwan-e-khas in fort. This portion was used for the special people and was built by the Shahjahan. Diwan-e-Aam was built for the general public hearings. Maktib Khana of the fort was favorite of Shahjahan and Jahangir. Sheesh Mahal in the fort was made by white and unique marbles, whereas the efficient mirror working also increase the beauty of Sheesh Mahal. Mughal Emperor Shahjahan built a mosque ‚ÄúMoti Masjid‚Äù in the Lahore Fort.

Haveli of Mai Jindan and Haveli of Kharaksingh are also the part of fort. Haveli of Mai Jindan was the living place of Emperor Dulip Singh mother‚Äôs. Naulakha is another monument associated with the Sikh emperors. This structure has the capability to compete with the Sheesh Mahal in the fort. Jhangir adds a Daulat-Khana, where the ornaments were used for designing purpose. Most of the Mughal evidences are demolished in the fort by Sikh‚Äôs and British. But one can easily examine the skills and abilities of the past people and their love to the combination of art and engineering. Other structures in the Lahore Fort are Khawabgah, Hamam, Jahangir‚Äôs Quadrangle, Intizar gah, Khilwat Khana (Khassa Khana) and Shah Burj."
"British were responsible for the desecration of many of Lahore's tombs and monuments. At one stage the Attorney General maintained an office at the Shah Chiragh Mosque, dak bungalows were built for the weekends at Shalamar Gardens. Anarkali's tomb was used as an office and later consecrated as a place of worship called St. Adrew's Church. It can also be conjectured that Lahore was an industrial center in the Moghul period. The famous guns which lie in front of the Central Museum and other places were molded in the foundries of Lahore. Their perfection shows that the industry was quite advanced. Within the walled city you may come across old Havelis or the spacious houses of the rich, which give you an inkling of the style of the rich and notables in the Moghul reign. Efforts are being made to preserve some of the buildings, along with their environments, but a great deal needs to be done to maintain them for posterity.

The British during their reign (1849 -1947) compensated Lahore, by harmoniously combining Mughal, Gothic and Victorian styles of architecture. Victorian heritage is only next to Mughal monuments. The GPO and YMCA buildings built to commemorate the golden jubilee of Queen Victoria - an event marked by the construction of clock towers and monuments all over India. They built some important buildings, like the High Court. the Government College, the Museums, the National College of Arts, Montgomery Hall, Tollinton Market, the Punjab University (Old Campus) and the Provincial Assembly. At one end of The Mall stands the University - perhaps the largest center of educat"
"Easy access on main road next to Bank and  Market .Clean good size AC  rooms like proper hotel style .
Humble and co-operative staff especially the one who I spoke to from UK I think Amir Ali. The downside was no cupboard in my room
Rates are OK may be negotiable but I did not try. Some cheaper option are there but have  their downside.
I would definitely recommend at these  Charges  üëå I suggested hostess trolley, uniforms and Delivery Menue from Savour.
BTW their omelette Breakfast made  by the Cook Gulraiz was fantastic."
Indeed a historical place worth visiting. Just to walk on same paths to see that tremendous structures being on this earth for centuries makes you wonder about the people who lived there. Their lives their feelings their experience just to imagine life in those times. It's a great site to watch. Apart from that it was very crowded and need great effort to restore this place as it seems that condition of building is getting bad day by day.
The ticket price was 50 rupees. There is Sheesh Mahil inside the fort and they were charging 100 rupees for it.  There was proper cleaning on the roads inside the fort. Overall good experience.
An absolutely must watch for children and adults alike. It's gigantic in size and every aspect of the fort takes you back to Mughal empire in Indian suncontinent. The fort is very well maintained and has a ticket for entry. You can book a guided tour if you like. If you don't feel like walking there's a caddy you can book to show you around. You've to go visit it if you're in town.

however it was also taken over by Sikh for 45 years, post mughar era and they took alot of the valuable gems engraved, chandi doors, marbles and what not from the fort and took it to the golden temple Amritsar. So sad.

But walking through the fort, you can feel the grandeur these emperors used  to live in."
"Excellent tourist point
Amazed with the construction equipment they used in building it"

"The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs. A marvel of the mughal empire. Such a mystery in this place for those who love history."
The place which take you a decade back and what come in mind that these people were ruled the area and how great mind they have but died at last..one should think always death and do good things ..
Must visit place for families. It is a huge place so one day is recommended to be spent there. You will find cafes inside with souvenirs shops too. Prayers areas are also present. Picnics are allowed so be sure to either eat there or bring your own food to enjoy there with the views. Guides tours also available.
A glory named Lahore Fort. Great place to visit. Early morning 8:00 am is the best time. Ticket is 50 Rs. Golf cart ride is 90 Rs. Picturesque and grandeur in itself.
Great architecture masterpiece by mughals. So much wide and long that you need a whole day night to explore it. You can seee mufhal artwork and culture there and lost in that era.  Sheesh mehal is also inside in it.
"If you can handle all the different historical periods which have impacted this Fort, you get a good overview of the full history of Pakistan. There are many different aspects to the Fort spread over a large area. Some of the most renowned parts of the Forrt were closed for renovation when we were there, and other parts were being renovated or clearly in need of repairs. But even so, this site is well worth a visit, and worth spending a couple of hours at least"
"Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia,¬†the first record of a fortified structure at the site was regarding an 11th-century mud-brick fort.The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs.¬†Additions from the¬†Shah Jahan¬†period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs,¬†while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors,¬†Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned¬†Badshahi Mosque."
"The present design and structure of the fort trace its origins to 1575 when the Mughal Emperor¬†Akbar¬†occupied the site as a post to guard the northwest frontier of the empire.¬†The strategic location of Lahore, between the¬†Mughal territories¬†and the strongholds of¬†Kabul,¬†Multan, and¬†Kashmir¬†necessitated the dismantling of the old mud-fort and fortification with solid brick masonry.Lofty palaces were built over time, along with lush gardens.¬†Notable Akbar period structures included the¬†Doulat Khana-e-Khas-o-Am,¬†Jharoka-e-Darshan, and¬†Akbari Gate. Many Akbari structures were modified or replaced by subsequent rulers."
"Currently being renovated,  but you can feel the glory of the Mughals at its peak. V informative and the newly built weapons museum is a must visit.
All 400 years saved till date. Worth the trip"
Nice place specially for kids to know them about history. How beautifully the fort was built and how good it looks even after centuries of it completion. This gives an immense view and a flashback of the history that how the mughals used to live and how they protect themselves from their enemies during the war. How lavish their lifestyle was. A must see for every countryman specially for the students of history.
"Lahore fort is one of the great visiting destination in Lahore, Pakistan. It is easily accessible through public transport or personal vehicle. It tells about the history of Mughal Kingdom. There are multiple visiting places in suroundings of the Fort i.e. Minar E Pakistan (in Memory of March 23, 1940 Pakistan resolution), Badshahi Mosjid, Gurdwara and Food street. It's a beautiful place to visit in Lahore."
"A place of great historical value, got architectural heritage and very good ambiance. Also it is being cared and maintained really well.You have to buy tickets at the entry and it is just opposite of famous Badshahi mosque."
"Incredibly well maintained and clean place it is a role model for all other departments dealing with tourism in Pakistan. Well done Walled City Authority. They have qualified and knowledgeable guides, it is advised that they should be hired fir a better experience. They are offering this facility online."
"BEWARE!!!
Somehow a tourism hotspot has become a racist hotspot instead!
From being referred to as foreigners even with our nationality cards to prove we are in fact Pakistani Nationals to being pointed at with ‚Äúlook at his clothes he‚Äôs not Pakistani‚Äù, the racism is rife in the country with a seeming hatred towards any foreigners/tourists!
No place is worth being demeaned that low, shows just how bad Pakistan has become and shows exactly why no matter what Pakistan tries to improve, until the mentality changes, it‚Äôll remain a third world country with a struggling economy and a massive population in poverty.
This was not what Mohammad Ali Jinnah represented."
"Punjab ki shan lahore ki pehchan safeguard of old walled city of lahore
Most beautiful and graceful piece of art must visit one time
Treasure for overseas guest"
"One of best historical places I ever visited in my life. Capturing a lot of ancient traditions, ammo's and life style of peeps of that time..One can imagine the whole story of empire just by viewing the views of fort."
"It is a great place to visit with family and friends. The fascinating thing for me was the symmetery of architecture. A real marvel I must say. It's currently under renovation but still open for visitor. If you are in Lahore, definitely visit the fort."
"Awesome place.. Just need to do some renovation work on some parts of the forts because there are some safety issues when you travel with the kids. Secondly, should have written the history of each place in the fort and the mosque because most of the people show interest to know the history about each building/ place."
"I loved the Lahore fort more from a historical perspective than anything else, reminds a lot of Windsor castle in terms of how general castles or forts were designed. However the fort is in a sorry state and is pretty dilapitated at places, parts of the reconstruction seems to be done by a company that has no idea on renovation based on period tools and materials. Second peeve is the fact that there isn't a place to buy a guide book on the fort, there should be an official guide which describes various aspects of the Fort and some back ground of the various features, nor is there any souvenir shop (again that's just me, it would be nice to pick up a fridge magnet or scaled model fort to remind me of the visit, apart from the snaps. Lastly there are many touts that try to sell you a ""guided tour"" however I'm not sure how much of that they present is fact or fiction, again it would be constructive to have official guides."
"Entry ticket is Rs. 50 for adults and Rs. 30 for kids. Tickets for foreigners are expensive. To get into Sheesh Mahal, you again need to pay Rs. 100 for adults.

From here 1 or gate 5, either you can walk or take the soft-wheel tram or horse-buggy, costing Rs. 50 per seat.

Since it is a big fort, you are advised to wear comfortable shoes and bring your kids' strollers.

Overall, a must-see place in Lahore!"
"The¬†LahoreFort is a¬†citadel¬†in the city of¬†Lahore,¬†Punjab,¬†Pakistan located at the northern end of¬†walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20¬†hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Mughal Emperor¬†Akbar."
"The fort is nothing short of incredible. Iconic gate, amazing history, beautiful architecture, stunning views, lovely grounds, and an important architectural and historical monument. Don't miss it."
"Oh man what a place. History and full of master pieces. It shows that how skilled the old workers were. I means it seems like magic when you see and get to know that how old are these buildings and still in our era nothing is like them. Gigantic, myterious and historic."
The fort is great and lot of history but the management over there is poor. Every there try to loot and scam. And be aware from fraud and pick pockets.
"This is well maintained fort,in these days new places are being discover.it has two museums which are very unique.it is nice, beautiful and a huge fort my kids enjoyed here very much."
Largest mural wall .old and unique.our profesional guide very keen telling the story even in the hot sun!
Badshahi Qila built again because many places are destroyed his management teem find many things of old culture from qila and shown in museum
This is one of the best historical place and point in pakistanüáµüá∞and lahore and i think the world too üíù.This is the most visited tourist point in the üåé. I'm loving it ‚ù£Ô∏è There are many secret tunnelsüî•
"Ahhhh what a beautiful heritage we have. No doubt it's a beautiful place, no doubt fort is marvellous but now a days it's condition is deteriorating day by day due to negligence on part of city govt. So city govt authorities must start working to save the original beauty of this place.
And I wish Mughal Kings would have constructed some university instead of this fort or parallel with fort."
"A beautiful place full of history and culture. It's better if you take a tour guide with you - they offer tours from half an hour to 3 hours long, and are able to truly help you appreciate the fort. Afterwords, do get some unique souvenirs from the shops inside - they are authentic and make great gifts."
"The Lahore Fort is the star attraction of the Old City. Note that the museums here may close an hour or so before sunset.The fort was modified by Jehangir in 1618 and later damaged by the Sikhs and the British, although it has now been partially restored. Within it is a succession of stately palaces, halls and gardens built by Mughal emperors Akbar, Jehangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, comparable to and contemporary with the other great Mughal forts at Delhi and Agra in India. It's believed that the site conceals some of Lahore's most ancient remains.
The fort has an appealing 'abandoned' atmosphere (unless it's packed with visitors) and although it's not as elaborate as most of India's premier forts, it's still a fabulous place to simply wander around.
The fort is entered on its western side through the colossal Alamgiri Gate, built by Aurangzeb in 1674 as a private entrance to the royal quarters. It was large enough to allow several elephants carrying members of the royal household to enter at one time. The small Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) was built by Shah Jahan in 1644 for the private use of the ladies of the royal household and was restored to its original delicacy in 1904.
The Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) was built by Shah Jahan in 1631, with an upper balcony added by Akbar. It's where the emperor would make a daily public appearance, receive official visitors and review parades.
Khawabgarh-i-Jehangir (Jehangir's Sleeping Quarters), a pavilion on the north side of his quadrangle, now houses a small museum of Mughal antiquities. One charming story about Jehangir is that he had a chain suspended outside the fort, which anyone unable to obtain justice through the usual channels could pull. A bell would ring in his private chambers and the petition would receive his personal attention.
Moving west, another graceful pavilion, the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), was built by Shah Jahan for receiving guests.
The Shish Mahal (Palace of Mirrors), built by Shah Jahan in 1631, was closed for renovation at the time of research, but should be open by the time you read this. Decorated with glass mirrors set into the stucco interior, it was built for the empress and her court and installed with screens to conceal them from prying eyes. The walls were rebuilt in the Sikh period, but the original marble tracery screens and pietra dura (inlay work) are in remarkable condition. The view from here over the rest of the fort and Badshahi Mosque is rewarding.
Naulakha is the marble pavilion on the west side of the quadrangle, lavishly decorated with pietra dura - studded with tiny jewels in intricate floral motifs. It was erected in 1631 and its name, meaning nine lakh (900,000), refers either to the price to build it or the number of semiprecious stones used in its construction.

You can exit the fort from here, down the Hathi Paer (Elephant Path) and through Shah Burj Gate; if you do, look behind to see the fine painted tilework of the outer wall.

There are three small museums on site (photography prohibited): the Armoury Gallery exhibits various arms including pistols, swords, daggers, spears and arrows; the Sikh Gallery predominantly houses rare oil paintings; and the Mughal Gallery includes among its exhibits old manuscripts, calligraphy, coins and miniature paintings, as well as an ivory miniature model of India's Taj Mahal.Incredibly well maintained and clean place it is a role model for all other departments dealing with tourism in Pakistan. Well done Walled City Authority. They have qualified and knowledgeable guides, it is advised that they should be hired fir a better experience. They are offering this facility online."
"Very historical, very magical. I will recommend to find a good guide and let him explain you the stories. With them it makes much more sense.
Just don't go with his speed. Any guide will try to rush you through. Just be calm, take your time. Sit whenever and wherever you wants to. Enjoy you time at max. Don't eat much from canteen inside. There are lot of restaurants just outside Fort. Try to spend 3-4 hours and try to visit different floors. Gardens are good. Sheesh mehal and it's stories are most mesmorising.

Have fun :)"
Wow  great place especially for youngsters who have interest in history ..... These antique buildings are fabulous .... Must visit üëç
"Memorable, enjoyed alot to see"
"Parking is closed since 4 months.
If you gotta park Badshahi masjid Nikah road.
Do not be using the parking spot they charge 200 according to the mood of the security guard.
Place is being renovated and new discoveries are being made. A must visit place."
"I recommend this place must to visit if anyone have ever being to Lahore.
Ancient Mughul history and very rear art culture is the main thing about this fort.
It shows the living and architecture style of subcontinent builders and the strong building base of this fort as it is standing still without any damage even after hundred of years.
Travelers and explorers really love it."
"One of the top sites to see when in Lahore. Lahore fort has so much to offer to its visitors. First owned by Mughals and then by Sikhs, this place has hundreds of years of history embedded. This place is surrounded by the other significant monuments which also depicts its importance.
This site is crowded mainly on public holidays but even during working days,  people come here in the afternoon with their families and enjoy themselves in vast and beautiful grounds here."
Lahorer is a very historical city. lahore fort is a mughal architecture very beautiful.museum is a wonderful . i prefer tourist guide. because without guied we don't know well about place.must bring water and some food. fort must tired you.
"This place was beautiful, with so much history and meticulous detailing. Such a pity I was there during summer when it was a scorching 37deg celsius. The fort is huge. Would have loved to spend more time there"
"Lahore Fort (ÿ¥ÿß€Å€å ŸÇŸÑÿπ€Å) is one of the most important and popular landmark in Pakistan Lahore
Full of historical information"
Historical place. Fort should be repaired to its original state if they want to attract the travelers. Undergrounds are sealed which is really bad.
"the first record of a fortified structure at the site was in regard to an 11th-century mud-brick fort.[2] The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs.[2] Additions from the Shah Jahan period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs,[2] while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the Mughal Emperors, Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned Badshahi Mosque.

And after the rise of the Maratha Empire leading to the fall of the Mughal Empire, the Lahore Fort was used as the residence of Emperor Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh Empire. The fort then passed to British colonialists after they annexed Punjab following their victory over the Sikhs at the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849. In 1981, the fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its ""outstanding repertoire"" of Mughal monuments dating from the era when the empire was at its artistic and aesthetic zenith.[2]
A day is very short to visit every area of fort in detail."
"One of top attraction of Lahore - the walled city in ancient times. Lahore fort is an amazing architecture and best artistic work of carved stones and glass work. Sheesh mahal is the best thing to see.. It is a full day activity to cover Greater Iqbal park, Lahore fort, Badshahi Mosque and Gurdwara.. I love to go there again and again.."
"The Lahore Fort ( Shahi Qila, or ""Royal Fort"") is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar.

Amazing experience amazing place to visit ! Historic place and well maintained
"Love the grandeur of this place its such a magnificent Architectural Landmark that needs extreme care from the authorities.
I remember when I was a little girl and visited the fort it was in much better shape we visited the underground harms and many things but this time the sheeh mahal was not even open for public due to renovations.
I hope they preserve this massive piece of history.
Will always visit whenever I go to Lahore.
Must visit if you go to Lahore."
A historically loved place. You can feel mystical attraction visiting different corners of this place. Amazingly beautiful landscape and a place to earn hope and tranquility.
"Outclass
I visited lahore fort first time in 2010 how ever this time I was surprised by work done by Aga Khan Culture & Heritage"
A greate public place by mughal era.wish for better management. Very good place for young kids who want to learn about our history. Very few options to eat there need to upgrade the cafeteria. And you can also buy swords and ancient hand weapons for decoration.
"One of the most famous architectural and cultural heritage of Indo-Pak subcontinent. Though with time the building is set in ruins but ever since the management is under WCLA (Walled City Lahore Authority) the renovation is taking place at quite a rapid pace and keeping the original look of the place intact. Lahore fort is now a UNESCO heritage site.

IF YOU EVER VISIT AND ASKED FOR A TOUR GUIDE, DO ASK THEM TO ARRANGE SPECIAL VISITS TO UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND BARRACKS. THEY TEND TO SKIP THIS FASCINATING PART.

With the inauguration of special night visits of the walled city, the fort has become a special focus of attention because of its vastness and diversity of beautified scenes.

DO TAKE AT LEAST ONE NIGHT TOUR. THEY PROVIDE YOU WITH GUIDE AND A TOUCH OF HISTORIC REALITY.
Night tours cost Rs.1000/- per head (subject to change)."
"A great historical place and heritage for Lahore, It just refreshes the old memory whenever i visit the place i am lost in old times in my imagination i see those places with old people lived there."
Lahore fort is one of the fabulous historical places of Pakistan. It has an amazing spirituality. There is a Moti Masjid And Shahi mosque.. A person feels good to spend sometime there.
"Very delicate art work in the Naulakha (vicinity of sheehmahal)
Although some stone work has been carved out and lotted in British era. Still the glory remains."
"It pains me to see terrible condition of Lahore Fort is in at the moment, given the fact, it carries a great history. A repair work is going but more extensive repair work is required. Staff was not very friendly. Staff of Fort needs proper training in public relations and management. Guided tours are really expensive and not up to mark. A lot need to done to make it a interesting and profitable site again. Plus there should be a proper cafeteria inside like as well suvinor shop like in all historical buildings."
"Marvelous historic place to visit. I visited the Lahore fort after a very long time and that too was insisted by my daughter. I was amazed to see a huge number of people visiting the fort. We had a marvelous guide who guided us through. A well acknowledged person. It was fun moving with him as he kept telling us story of each area we visited, and it looked as if we were in old times and everything was happening in front of our eyes. From the movement of elephants to the kings palace and visiting haram, it was a exciting experience."

Awesome Historic place to visit...  History related to Pakistan and symbols of Mughal Architecture can be observed here...  Alot of things about Royal life....  It has 57 acres of land most of it consists of buildings and a few for gardens and playing area.  Archeology and Walled city both holds this Fort."
Well worth the visit. Busy place.Alot of history here.
"500 rps for tourists !! 30 for citizens ,, it's Need to be more organized , by signs , walkways and marks for the buildings inside, but it's very big and nice open green space like a garden from inside"
"Lahore Fort (Shahi Qila) is a historical place and a famous tourist attraction. Fortunately, we got a FREE guided tour."
A very exotic place to watch. It really will remind you the lush Mughal architecture. The beauty is pretty much personified here. This will surely take you back to the Mughal era.!
"I was hungry with my friend. People came from a long time Light light rain made Trip even beautiful. also the mizar e iqbal and badshahi mosque are also beautiful places there to visit..very beautiful place at lahore more then 3 hundred an fifty years old. this fort was made by king shahjahan in 16th century.And after the fall of the Mughal Empire, the Lahore Fort was used as the residence of Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh Empire.

Card attached of our professional and knowledgeable tour guide."
Lahore fort also known as Shahi Qilla is one of the oldest structure in Lahore. The building has a lot of historic significance and has several view points. If you are in Lahore then this fort is a must go place surrounded by many historic buildings and monuments.

"Lahore Fort is one of the historical buildings of Old Lahore. It's located in front of very big Badshahi Mosque. Fort is beautiful & quite big in size. My grandfather (Morher's father) was employee here. So, I've emotional attachment with it too.
Fort has different sections including stunning Shish Mahal (Palace of Mirror).
The art of the fort building is reflects a series of monuments from Mughal Emperor Akbar (ruled: 1556 ‚Äì 1605) to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb (ruled: 1658 ‚Äì 1707 ). Expensive Marble, Precious & semi precious stones were used a lot during construction.
Unfortunately, during Sikh Ruler Ranjit Singh, Lahore fort was looted & demaged by Sikhs. Later on,  Colonial rules came but it didn't proved good for fort either.
Every year, more than million people visit Lahore Fort. So, it is quite popular tourist point. A perfect family picnic area indeed."
I went to Lahore fort since 2015. I was really excited to visit the fort.
Grand beauty of Mughal empire
"Lahore Fort or Shahi Qila Lahore locates at the northern end of Lahore with history dating back to 15th century and rebuilt in 17th century. After the fall of Mughal Empire, Ranjit Singh is said to take the charge of Qila and used it for personnel residence for years. It spreads on an area of 50 acres and worth seeing."
"Lahore Fort is very old fort. In ancient time it was developed by Mughal Prince Jahangeer.
In these days this fort is only for visitors now. It's a great historical place in Lahore to those people who have crazy to see the old things like that."
"The current form of the Lahore Fort was given by Emperor Akbar,in 1566 when he made Lahore the capital of his rule.
The fort was modified by Jehangir in 1618 and later damaged by the Sikhs and the British, although it has now been partially restored.

To better understand the fort's history you can hire a guide for Rs 150. In addition, Lahore Fort, Pakistan's Glorious Heritage, a colour booklet by Muhammad Ilyas Bhatti, sells here for Rs 150.

An autorickshaw/taxi from The Mall to Lahore Fort should cost about Rs80/Rs200."
"Care is being taken upto good extent to preserve this historical asset. Great Nations always do like this. Question arises that Is there any official of Govt Of Pakistan who may kindly take care of """"Kot Digi Fort"""" near Ranipur Sind ?????"
Well preserved historical Place of Mughal Emperor..good place to visit ..
"Such a good historical place
I was there alone and so good to be there
By tourists perspective it is the most attractive place
Shahi qilla
Baadshahi masjid
And minar_e_pakistan and more historical things about this place
Also attractive for those kids trip who want to know about hitory of Pakistan and history of mughal's"
Beautiful and amazing place to visit. Sadly it‚Äôs not getting attention what it should be getting. Since my childhood I hardly seen any changes. Hardly any money has been put to restore its beauty.
"Beautiful place to visit. It contains ancient swords, guns and other piece of armoury museum. Some other beautiful places like Badshahi mosque and Minar e Pakistan can also be seen clearly from its top."
"Interesting historical place, but in desperate need of repair. It is a huge fort. Lots of walking is involved. If you happen to be a fair-skinned westerner expect to be the center of attention! Place has a lot of potential but currently there are very few signs explaining the history. Inside are a few rooms with artefacts but the best part is probably the two guys dressed up as Moghul warriors. Have a photo for 100rp!"
An historic fort. A great architecture of Mughal era built in walled city of Lahore. The architecture shows the traditions and living style of Mughals
"What a place, showcases the artistic work of the Mughal Empire. Great for Tourism and spending a full day there. And has a wonderful historical places near like Minar e Pakistan, Badshahi Mosque, Allama Iqbal Tomb. Without visiting this in Lahore, tour will be incomplete."
"Do not go sightseeing in Lahore unless you have a proper tour guide! I've been here so many times before, but for the first time we decided to go with a guide by the name of Shahid, whom we found on trip advisor. He skillfully transported us into the Mughal era with their wars and epic love stories in English and in Urdu. As I've said, I've seen the Fort, the mosque, and the Mughal relics before, but never with an understanding of how incredible and rich Lahore's history actually is. Do yourself a favor, do it right and go with a tour guide."
"The fort is small compared to many other forts in the region, with a small.museum inside. Random 'tour guides' will request to bring you around for a fee.."
Very good place to visit. If you don't know Lahore Fort is 8 manzala but we are allowed to see only one of them. The top one. But it was good experience there.
"Lahore Fort is worth watching place. Mughals Art . Wonderful places like Sheesh Mahal , Balcony, everything, the Allam Iqbal Tomb, Badshahi Masjid in one place. Insha Allah I will visit again and again. I love the place üíñü§©üíñ. Highly
Recommended to visit the Historical sites with family."
"Historical place with very interesting building here
Must visit to add your knowledge"
"Good historical place to visit, but poorly cared for by government.. No renovation, no cleanliness, no upgradation... Just earning machine for gov. Thats a sad thing for me. üò£"
It was interesting and comparatively well maintained. The entrance ticket is 30 PKR but the ticket for the Sheesh Mahal is 100 additional rupees. It's worth exploring.

"Lahore Fort also known as Shahi Qila is located in north-western corner of the historical city of Lahore. Though irregular in scheme the fort measures about 427 meters east-west and 335 meters north-south excluding the fortification wall added later during the Sikh rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1799 ‚Äì 1839 A.D).

The chequered history of the fort is a living witness of the zenith and nadir of the Mughals, the Sikhs and the colonial rulers. The art of the fort building is reflects a series of monuments from Emperor Akbar (ruled: 1556 ‚Äì 1605) to the Aurangzeb (ruled: 1658 ‚Äì 1707 ).

The court of Emperor Akbar occupies the south-east area of the fort but most of the building have been extinct and the Masti / Akbari is still facing the Maryam Zamani Mosque. The northern half of the fort with its architectural beauty is divided into six quadrangles; from Akbari Gate to Shish Mahal."
"Lahore fort is such a historical place, it is magnificent and quite gigantic fort of time but still  I dont know why people visit historical places."
"The Lahore Fort contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendor and opulence."
Beautiful place about mughal history
"A great place worth of visiting to witness Mughal Dynasty glamour, every part of Lahore Fort is a unique piece of art, architecture & beauty.
One can experience time travel to Mughal Dynasty, when Fort was in actual use of Mughals.
The place is a complete History Book & inside fort museum also tells a great story of that era."
"Lovely place, everyone should visit this place. On weekends it's very russhy. Minar e Pakistan, Badshahi Mosque, Allama Iqbal tomb, Fort, Sikh Gurdwara, Shesh Mehal, Sher e Punjab raja Ranjeet Singh horse , all are in one place."
"The Fort needed more renovation, Some rooms were out of order and open and when you go near those room the officials of the fort will come to humiliate you. Some monumental standing were used to store waste and they had not been preserved and it was obvious that they may extinct in the few coming years."
One of the best historic place to visit. Neat and Clean environment üôÇ with greenery.
"Lahore Fort also known as ""Shahi Qila"" is one of the key attraction of the old city.
This place is open for tourists 7 days a week. An entrance ticket is required to enter inside the Fort and the one can either walk inside or get an electric cart ride which is very economical and useful specially if you are with kids.
The place is very popular and lots of local and foreign tourists likes to visit it.
A must visit place bo matter what part of world you are coming from.
Both Badshahi Mosque and Minar e Pakistan are on the walking distance. You'll definitely get some nice clicks üì∏.
Feel free to contact me on +923018564789 if you are coming Lahore and would like to discuss your tour plan, accommodation etc. I'll give you my honest advice. üè∞"
"One of the most famous historical sights of Pakistan. It is full of rich history. However, during to poor management and vandalism from the general public the fort seems neglected which is very sad given how important the place is. Some areas of the fort are unaccessible but can be accessed by contacting the management prior or during the visit."
"üö©Now in Pakistan, this fort was the Capital of the Sikh Empire when Raja Ranjit Singh founded the Sikh Empire and entered this Lahore Fort in 1799. This fort was of a significant importance under the regime of Raja Ranjit Singh who ruled the Provinces of Multan, Sindh, Punjab and Indian Punjab under the Sikh Empire. The Marathas had also captured this fort for a little more than 2 years before the Sikhs, when they were Chasing Ahmed Shah Abdali during the latter's 2nd expedition of India in 1758. The then Maratha General was Raghunathrao Peshwa and Manaji Paygude entered the fort to unveil the Saffron Flag of the Marathas in April 1758.üö©"
"The fort was initially constructed in 1566 AD by the Mughal Emperor Akbar, on the ruins of a mud fort which existed as early as 1021 AD. The Fort is rectangular and is located in the north western corner of Lahore, adjacent to the Walled City. It has 13 gates. The main gates are located alongside the center of the western and eastern walls. Located centrally in the city of Lahore, the Lahore Fort is a magnificent fortified palace complex. Its elaborate Mughal architecture is straight out of a storybook of the Mysterious East. The impressive twin-domed entrance leads into elaborately decorated courtyards and pavilions with water features, some with still intact sumptuous wall decorations of inlaid semiprecious stones and painted designs. It's large enough to allow several elephants carrying members of the royal family to enter at one time. There are a flight of stone steps specially built for ceremonial elephant processions.
The fort as it stands today is not what it was when it was initially constructed in 1566. Every successive Mughal emperor besides the Sikhs, and the British added a pavilion, palace of wall to the Fort. Jahangir, Shah Jehan and later Aurangzeb added modifications of massively fortified walls. .It has two gates one is known as Alamgiri Gate build by Emperor Aurangzeb which opens towards Badshahi Mosque and other older one known as Maseeti (Punjabi language word means of Masjid) or Masjidi Gate which opens towards Masti Gate Area of Walled City and was built by Emperor Akbar. Currently Alamgiri Gate is used as the principal entrance while Masti Gate is permanently closed. Akbar got the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall for Commoners) built in the traditional Iranian style, all constructed in red sand stone imported from Rajistan. Shah Jahan also constructed the Diwan-e-Khas, which overlooked Ravi, in 1631-the same year he started the Taj Mahal. Shah Jahan also constructed Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) and his own sleeping chambers. Emperor Jahangir extended the gardens and constructed the palaces in the Jehangir's Quadrangle."
"The fort and the mosque are the best tourist spots in Lahore. No trip to this cultural City is complete without a stop over at the food Street and a Desi nastah, followed by a tall glass of peyray wali lassi. That's food coma right there. Then a nice long walk through the Iqbal Park to the Minar-e-Pakistan. Almost done, you turn to the Fort and imagine the grandness of days past. Finally you walk to the entrance of the 5th largest mosque in Asia. Sit in contemplation or walk the vast length of the House of God. Lastly, if it's evening, go back to the food Street and have dinner at one of the rooftop restaurants. The view is magnificent."
"Great fort in the heart of Lahore. The place is in the vicinity of the Badsaha mosque, a Sikh temple, and another historic landmark. The fort lies on the bay of the Ravi River. Fine architecture with Mughal era design is visible in the fine fort. The place is the absolute witness of the Mugal Regime which demonstrate the ancient art and culture. A similar kind of for we can find in Delhi i.e. Redfort. The same design, the same architect lies there. Absolute art with fine finishing is the charector of this fort."
"Lahore fort is a beautiful historical place situated near minar_e_pakistan. Great amusement place for both adults and kids to walk around and explore the history of our heroes. It consists of 8 parts like Ahaata_e_Jahangiri and others which add to its beauty. Lahore fort also has meauseum, armor house, shahi remainings and dewaan.  In short Lahote fort is way big to explore just found leisure time for outing and take your family there. üòò"
Indeed a great heritage. Now they also have facility of showing fort on mini open buses. A great step for those who have less time.

"A large and impressive fort constructed over many years with influences from Emperors Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. The craftmanship is outstanding from the imposing Alamgiri gate, the various quadrangles and pavilions, and the Sheesh Mahal. I always find the ""elephant"" steps unique and marvelled at how they would have elephants also within the fort. A must visit location full of Mughal history."
Mesmerizing and awesome historical place. A must go-to if you are in Lahore. One of the best touring palace.

"The Lahore Fort is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar."
"A place which I visits once a year, my attention first drew to this marvel back in 2010, when I first visit this place despite of my childhood visits which merely visible to me, As a history student this attracts me to study it more, There's hidden passages and places still exists to date.
Every time I visits this place I came to new information and knowledge of the past, The history of subcontinent originally built before 11th-century a mud-brick fort later rebuilt in 17 century. It is archaeology wonder."
"An excellent historical place to visit again and again. During visiting this place, one knows sublimity of archetechture of Mughal Era in the history of Hindustan."

"Although a good historical place to visit but now should name as prohibited fort because everywhere u can see a board written on it ""prohibited area""."
"This is historical place and full of history. If you are in Lahore and missed this place you will always regret it.
This place is full of stories of history. Must visit"
Loved it. Entry ticket is around 20 to 30 rupees but for foreigners it's around 400 to 500 rupees. Neatly maintained with guide available.
It's a shame that public has damage tourist attraction (fort) as much as they could . They have written names number and alot of more ... even they have damaged walls and brack all the mirrors . Thanks to govt of punjab they trying to maintain it and restrict some of the previous areas
"I went to the Dastan Goi ( Storytelling) event held at night in the Lahore Fort and really enjoyed the event but what really caught my eye was the the beauty of this centuries old building brought forth by the lighting. Walled City Lahore Authority has done some excellent work in restoring some parts of the Fort while also allowing the ruins of the old structures to coexist with these restorations, so as to accentuate the ancientness of the building. One of the latest parts to be restored is the  Shahi Bawarchikhana ( the Royal Kitchen) which has also previously served as jail for dissidents."
"One of the must visit places for foreigners aswell as local tourists. A fort with a long history, built by Moguls. Highly recommended to visit with guide to know about different parts of the fort."
"Debris everywhere, structure damaged from multiple areas. Totally ignored by the authorities. A lot of effort and dedication is required for restoration. It's a historical asset but it is becoming history by every passing day. I was ashamed and outraged at the same time."
Best place to visit with family and kids. Best historical where local and foreigners love to come and enjoy its beauty to the fullest. Its just amazing.
"Lahore Fort, along with Badshahi Mosque is the identity sign of the historical city of Lahore. Historians say that there was a fort at this place more than 2000 years back, however, over the centuries many king and emperors have done construction here. Most of what is visible now was constructed in the times of Mughal Emperors, Akbar, Jahangir and Shahjahan mainly.
Shish Mahal is the most beautiful of all the buildings inside the fort. Even after many hundred of years, the palace of mirrors is still so impressive and strikingly beautiful.
There are 17 notable buildings inside the fort. Important ones include Dewane Aam, Jahangir's Quadrangle, ShahJahan's Quadrangle, Paen Bagh, Dewane Khas etc."
Shahi or lahore fort is located in the city of lahore in Punjab.the for spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It was made by mughal emperors.it is a great historical and architectural site of tourism in Lahore.
"Good to visit such a historical place but it is not well maintained by government of pakistan.. most of the upper story area are sealed and entrances to underground places are also sealed... must hire a good guide to understand different area of the fort...

Don't purchase the sanata car tickets it is waste of money.. if you feel tired don't visit the place as it would require 2 3 hours to fully cover up the whole fort..."
A good historical place to explore the history of Lahore and Mughals. Better to visit in fall or winter and summer could be very hot.
"Nice place to visit.

"One of the best places for visiting and school trips.You come to know your history and also thinking that nothing is for ever.Good efforts initiated by WALLED CITY LAHOR department for the conservation and restoration of different parts of this heritage and many of such places in lahore for the people after us.One of the things blessed by MUGHALS to lahore and pakistan,same idea is continued by Punjab government of pssing material things like roads,flyovers,underpasses metro etc.to the comming generations instead of education and khnowledge.No problem just keep on and you also will be remembered like the emprors in stories.For GOD's sake change your thinking and look out of the lahore you got 35 districts else,they also pay taxes,they give votes to you people.Dont their children have right of better life,better future.üò≠please reconsider the things...."

Parking is totally free and entry ticket are very cheap. A must visit place for families to get their children educated about the rich history and culture of this ancient region of world.
Walled city of Lahore, an organisation which is working to preserve our historical places amd revive their spirits in best ways, have really worked hard to attract more and more people with their hard work.
The Sheesh Mahal (light palace), gardens, Shahi Dard (Royal court), museums and different gates give a glimpse of different eras of this region. A must visit place to spend holidays in cool mornings and evenings in summers and sunny noons of winters along family and friends."
Lahorefort is a must visit historical place of lahore. Loved every bit of it
"The Lahore Fort (Punjabi and Urdu: ÿ¥ÿß€Å€å ŸÇŸÑÿπ€Å‚Ä¨‚Äé: Shahi Qila, or ""Royal Fort""), is a citadel in the city of Lahore,Punjab, Pakistan.The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares.It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar.

LAHORE FORT NEEDS MORE CONCENTRATED EFFORTS OF GOVERNMENT. ITS A NATIONAL HERITAGE BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT KEPT UPTO ITS POTENTIAL. THE INTERNAL BUILDING NEEDS TO BE OPENED OTHERWISE A ROUND OF A WELL MAMAGED LAWN DOESNT HAVE ANY MENAININGS.
"Excellent historical place of lahore attractive to pakistani visiting lahore and tourists from all over the world. Well maintained and further maintenance in progress.
Happy to see changes that some further staff employed to act as servants of king wearing ancient dresses used in kingdom era.
But some places inside forte occupied by Archeological department using it as offices. So visitors cannot enter to those places.
Main gate is closed now and no one can go that side.
So the beauty of main entrance gate couldn't be seen. Now the visitors enter from side gate."
"Great historical place to visit. Moreover, i think we should take our children there so they get knowledge about their ancestors."
Good place to visit and view the architecture of the Mughal buildings..
"A Great way to go back in time, the mighty walls just remind you, we humans have not changed much, overall a great experience, do visit with kids family solo OR with friends, It works every way"
Well maintained but more services for visitors can be introduced to make visit more easier & comfortable  . Ticket counter is not good and no SOPs being followed for covid19 prevention.
Historic and i am just spellbound by saying anything for this marvelous place in lahore .one of the oldest rich ancient cultural place in town for tourists.. Must Visit.
A great historic place by Mughal era. Wish for better management. Not a good place for children but very good place for young kids who want to learn about our history. Very few options to eat there wish to upgrade the cafe with good quality stuff. It have lovely souvenir shops with wide range üòçüòç. Overall good experience
Shahi Qila is located in the front of Badshahi Mosque . Everyone should visit this place and see the living styles of Kings before 300 years ago. The best time for visiting this place is before 5:pm because after 5 pm you can‚Äôt enter in the Shahi Qila. I have enjoyed this place. Families also can visit this place.
"Lahore fort is an historical place. It was established during the reign of Mughal Emperors. This fort is beautiful and mysterious. This was made as it gave not only a great piece of defense to Mughal kings. It gives a lot of support for long reign of Mughal emperors. I advice you to come and have a look at that melodious piece of artitecture. As we all know that, the building is very old. So the Govermnent should have to do some conservative steps for its existence for upcoming years. Otherwise, it is under a great threat. This building tells us history."

Additions from the Shah Jahan period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs,while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors, Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned Badshahi Mosque.

Try to go early in the day to avoid large crowds. You can hire a travel guide which will charge aroung 300 rupees or you can roam around yourself as well.
Went to see the concert of shafqat Amanat Ali. Wonderful feeling to be here after almost 40 years.
"I am literally vouching for the architecture. Loved what the history has to offer to witness in regards to the art and appeals, and how it's built, damage, demolished, rebuilt and restored several times. Fabulous place to just wander around a little bit and get into the vibes of badshahat."
"Good place to visit with friends and family, small amount entry ticket. Parks in front of Aiwan e aam  was well maintained. Near Sheesh mahal, mughal dresses were kept for photos.Small tuck shops were also present."
All is really good full injoy in Shahi qila nice to meet you anu and simran
"One of the must see places in Pakistan, full of history, mesmerising architecture and friendly cultures."
"A must see place for any one visiting Lahore. Great gardens, history and architecture."

Immerse yourself in culture and history. The fort was built in 15th century and is an architectural wonder
It is very ancient fort and  beautiful built. Now adays centre of attraction of tourists.
Stunning Standing Strong & Macho..could feel the aura of the olden kingdom....@Dzulkarnain Lahore Pakistan 16 January 2019.
Very good experience special thanks to Lahore wall city authority there stuff is very helpful and manage everything nicely
It is an historical fort. I love to visit every month this place. It takes about 1.5 to 2 hours to visit this place. And it's awesome for everyone to visit this historical place in night every Saturday night. The ticket for night visit is Rs.1000 each because the TDCP visits the underground part of this fort which I think should be visited. The tickets for night tour will be taken from Food street Shahi fort Lahore or office of the Walled City Authority of Lahore WCLA.
A Historical place it was also time here spend his life but now only his mamoery that people enjoying
"Beautiful place to go to to enjoy the night and culture of Lahore. There are two five star restaurants around Poet and Bandu Shah for the tourists and locals, and there are more than enough activities for kids. Bugy ride, train ride, open park space, go when the weather is good of course, which is now in winter/fall for Pakistan. I had a hard time finding good chai around here though, but still looking. And the fort closes 5:30, so make sure to go in time if you want to check inside."

Unlike - Worst Ever Canteens & Food. Worst Quality With High Prices. Very Expensive. No Staff. Druggers & Beggars Everywhere Which Should Be Noticed.
Harassment Is A Common Problem Of This Place."
A great history of great mughal emperors. The historical Picture wall has its own grace and importance. You should visit it with a guide or purchase some information booklet before visting.
"A wonderful splendid historical place, indeed an outstanding symmetry of architecture"
Lahore Fort is a great historical place to visit but authorities must be more attentive to preserve it. There have a lot of construction going on The outside of the fort for maintenance purposes. Some of the places inside the fort should also be maintained.

I m Soo excited when I visit it."
If anyone has even little interest in history then this is good place to visit.  Sign boards ate placed at various points in fort for guidance. Small vehicles are also available there for taking a round of fort. Some historic characters are also present there who talk in typical way and you can take pictures with them as well. Historic costumes are also available on rent for taking pictures. Children will also enjoy there.

It's a great place to visit with family and friends.But BE AWARE of stalker's and kidnappers. or ager ap fountain dancing tak rha ga to waha sham ko apko zada khiyal rakhna chahiya and if ur going to sheesh Mahal then DON'T go there alone.
Awesome place !!! Just need to do some renovation work of forts then looks more nice and should have written the history of each place.
Truly amazing. Many historical eras in one spot Its a must see place in lahore
It is a historical building from the Mughal era & is worth paying a visit to.
"One of the most amazing places if you want to go through to historic pages of Lahore. Govt. Should maintain it's building but day by day overall structure of the building is being damaged. Our people are also somewhat responsible for it's poor conditions as you can see people littering here and there and writing their names, phone numbers on walls for nothing. Let's be a responsible nation and promote our country as a best tourism spot which offers everything to the people of every interest."
"It's good historical place....visited it for the first time with my friends.....would like to suggest the reader, dont waste 100 rupees on Sheesh Mahal it was not so good and not even clean..."
"Very beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è place the place where you live in the history , the place where you know how the kings of asia live thier lives , very good place to visit please visit if you want to know the tradition of asia , tradition of subcontinent , and tradition of muslims üíï"

"Historically important place,but the there are so  many people going there so everyone need to take caution to avoid pickpocketing."
"Loved visiting the Lahore fort - glad to see that the mosque, the minar and the fort have been connectedvia the park. Wish the government put in more money on the maintenance of a gorgeous historice site."

One Of The Most Beautiful Places In Old Lahore A Project of Walled City Lahore Build During Mughal Empire Reign
A very good historical place must visit
That was awesone i suggest you guys must be visiting the lahore fort.. And Baad shahi Mosque....
Lahore fort is one of the best tourists attraction in old Lahore and it is world heritage site. The magnificent Alamgiri Gate of Lahore Fort was built by Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir in 1673.This is the gate which gives you the idea of how mighty and graceful are the Mughals... This gate is still in its form and presents wonderful view when you see it from Badshahi Mosque. I still remember the feelings of my childhood when I first visited this place back in eighties........ The Magnificent.
Good place to visit but in nice weather only otherwise it will be very tiring. The ticket cost Rs 30 per person and for van it is Rs 90 per person return
"A beautiful piece of history. A beautiful fort known as Lahore Fort or Badshahi Fort or Badshahi Qila is one of the must go places while you are in Lahore. And while it does require a lot more attention by the government it still is in much better shape. About 50% of the fort is open to visitors, rest is cordoned off, locked, bolted shut, grilled and what not. They were able to run water falls, ponds and fountains 100s of years ago the administration can‚Äôt make it run nowadays.
Tip: As far as access is concerned while searching in the Google Maps, search Minar e Pakistan Parking Stand otherwise Google Maps will drive you in circles."
Its historical place in Lahore and very very beautiful landmark in Lahore Pakistan and its attractive place for foreigner and tourist if you are looking for place in that then it's 100% recommended and very awesome place to visit your friends family and with your partner's because it's too much reflect are resilience our hospitality so if you are looking awesome place then definitely it's for you because they give you double opportunity because there are three or four landmark in one place like minare Pakistan Badshahi Masjid and Lahore Fort also
Very beautiful place & historical place I enjoyed here very much.
"I was stunned when visit Lahore Fort... The place is tremendous and one can think, how talented the mughuls were... When ever you were there... Just imagine that time when the fort had a king, the guards were everywhere... The time just passes away üò¢ but we are still stuck in this fake world... The moti masjid is great place.. Whenever you visit Lahore Fort, must pray in moti masjid"
Lahore Fort is situated in the heart of the city and it's one of the oldest fort of the country. Lahore Fort is historical building dating back to12th century when it was built with mud. Later on Mughal regime concurred it by Mughal empire Akber who ruled here. It was build and damaged many times by different rulers. Now it's open for public and it has long history details of which can be obtained at Google..

The first historical reference to a fort at the site is from the 11th century during the rule of¬†Mahmud of Ghazni. The fort was made of mud and was destroyed in 1241 by the¬†Mongols¬†during their invasion of Lahore.A new fort was constructed in 1267 at the site by Sultan¬†Balban¬†of the Turkic¬†Mamluk dynasty¬†of the¬†Delhi Sultanate.

In the 1430s, the fort was occupied by Shaikh Ali of¬†Kabul.
and remained under the control of the¬†Pashtun¬†sultans of the¬†Lodi dynasty¬†until Lahore was captured by the Mughal Emperor¬†Babur¬†in 1526. Continued....."
"One of the best places that captures the Mughal Empire history. The last time I visited was about 15 years ago. Between then and now, Iqbal park has been developed which makes the walk between Minar-e-Pakistan and the Fort very convenient. The Fort also offers the option of tour guides and mini vehicles to roam around. Sheesh Mahal was heavily protected, and that was the low point."
"The Lahore Fort is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares.

It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century, when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendour and opulence.

Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia, the first record of a fortified structure at the site was regarding an 11th-century mud-brick fort.

The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs.

Additions from the Shah Jahan period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs,while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors, Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned Badshahi Mosque.

After the fall of the Mughal Empire, Lahore Fort was used as the residence of Emperor Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh Empire. The Sikhs made several additions to the fort. It then passed to the control of the East India Company after they annexed Punjab following their victory over the Sikhs at the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849. In 1981, the fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its ""outstanding repertoire"" of Mughal monuments dating from the era when the empire was at its artistic and aesthetic zenith.

Historical place... A lot of knowledge to learn about the history
This is historical place and this place is best for students to increase the knowledge about our culture and hertiage
Well maintained and historically very beautiful place for visiting.
"Very historic place in Lahore I have visited in 2017 very nice environment good place, i will suggest you hire a guide who tell you about history and real stories of that particular place."
Wonderful as always. Majestic Historical Place.
Shahi qila also called historical place I recommend must visit
Four star for Fort but two star for the management. Not caring for the cleanliness and upkeep of such an important heritage of country. Government should take more measures to preserve it. Worst part was that people have written their one names on the walls. Even few people have carved their names and alphabets with sharp things on old walls.
It's a good place for family visit though government should seriously focus on its rennovations as most of the Fort is in disrepair
The primary heritage site in Lahore. The fort is large and takes a long time to walk through and look at the individual monuments. W arz comfortable shoes. Keep water with you.
"One of the flagship places of Lahore. If you're in Lahore and didn't visit Lahore Fort, there's no point in visiting!"
Best experience in Lahore fort and its historic museum and best place to visit.

"Last time I visited Lahore fort in 2003, now again got a chance to visit the fort in 2022, but I was really upset this time, it was not well maintained, concerned authorities should take notice and restore this beautiful and historical landmark not only for us but for our future generations"
Basically built for the defence of the territory in the mughal era now it is the heritage of the Pakistan. It sure was strong enough to stand against the enemies but special attention has been given to the aesthetics of the building by the architectures of those time. It is a master piece of art and really cool to look upon. It should be on the list of places to visit whenever you are in Lahore. Timing is strict to visit so try to manage to visit it during day time.
"There‚Äôs good experience of visiting at Lahore Fort
I had planned to lahore fort with my friends for 1 week ago.
At Lahore Fort you experience the old culture & civilisation and structure."

This is a Historical place in Lahore. Visited few time here with family... great moments the time spended here... enjoyedüòä
Amazing and beautiful place. It is mostly well maintained but there are certain areas i visited which needed repairs and one area that had its roof collapsed. Its full of rich history and i would advise to take a tour guide. I felt the need of a tour guide because i was visiting it for the first time and you may aswell if you happen to be a bit curious about the things you see.
People with families especially with females should pay attention to Islamic norms as this place is a mosque. So every one should respect it.
"Awesome experience, it's near to my maternals. I love the walled city of Lahore and it's street foods which are best in taste and prices are so economical."

A historical and memorable site to visit in Lahore
Beautiful place. Must keep it clean.
"So much history and culture in just one place. From the era of mughals to colonization by British the walls of this beautiful piece of history remain stoic in their silent whispers of the past - encapsulating the voices of the voiceless, the turmoil of the fallen empire and the astute conquer by the nation that redefined all metrics of the people who once dwelled the mighty subcontinent.
Now, on it's weakened knees yet still standing tall, the fort is still telling its tale to whoever wants to listen to this timless wall."
This place is amezing. The enviroment of the fort really inspiring.
Its a great historical place to visit..  Lot to learn..
A place full of History and cultral heritage.
"Historical place

It waz the .most  beautyful place i ever visited

"Ancient and historic landmark one gets amazed by the artwork and mastermind of that era.

Very beautiful and historic place.. Must visit
Absolutely amazing. It's a lot better if you have a guide who will educate you with the historic significance of each place. You can get a guide easily on the entrance of the fort. The best news about the place is that it's repair work is going on and it's structure is going to revived to the same as the times of the kings. Absolutely amazing.
Its quite interesting for traditional & historical references
"We are unfortunate for having such heritage. It was best place to visit in Lahore 2 decades ago. Now it has become ""public toilet"" for most of the people coming from outside. Sheesh mahal was under construction when i last visited, and now they reconstructed it with their local mindset and non artistic approach which gives an unpleasant effect.Most of the walls are dirty where you can see random people's names and their mobile numbers written with markers. Pathetic approach, really disappointed. They must charge such persons with heavy fine who use this place in such way."
"Lahore fort is very Cultural thing but a famous tourist attraction that starting from the Mughals emperors , Raja Ranjeet Singh, shahjaha etc."
"Lahore Fort, also locally known as the Royal Fort, is located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.  The fort is located on the northwest corner of the city.  Although the history of this fort goes back to ancient times, it was rebuilt by the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great (1605-1556 AD) while the later generations continued to renovate it.  Therefore, this fort is a magnificent example of Mughal architecture and tradition.  Some of the famous places inside the fort include Sheesh Mahal, Alamgiri Darwaza, Nolakha Mahal and Moti Masjid.  The fort was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1981 along with Shalamar Gardens."
My lifetime mange is here hard&esy time look forward running  all world knows people who want to me am hard up speak place old city Lahore Pakistan
"The¬†Lahore Fort¬†(Punjabi¬†and¬†Urdu:¬†ÿ¥ÿß€Å€å ŸÇŸÑÿπ€Å,¬†romanized:¬†ShƒÅhƒ´ QilƒÅ,¬†lit.‚Äâ'Royal Fort') is a¬†citadel¬†in the city of¬†Lahore,¬†Pakistan.[1]¬†The fortress is located at the northern end of¬†walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20¬†hectares.[2]¬†It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor¬†Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century,[3]¬†when the¬†Mughal Empire¬†was at the height of its splendour and opulence"
Excellent Place with lots of adventure and site seens.
"Perfect historical place for a days' family trip. Great architecture from the Mughal empire that is well preserved by the local government of Lahore. A mini museum is also located within the premises that preserves a huge collection of historical pictures, coins, armoury, dresses and antiques from last few centuries.

I highly recommend this place, visiting Lahore fort takes you back to old days and you can clearly feel the history of the beautiful walled city in the air."
Experience was good but i missed elephant ride
Very histirical place .it is made mughal badshah .
"Really wonder historical place,you can visit and see the awesome things here."
Lahore fort is awesome place for family.
Every time you visit you will enjoy every minute
"It is a  place worth seeing. Don't forget to watch the historical handwritten  manuscripts, the map, and the coins dating to the mughal Era placed inside the frames. Also, the model of Taj mehil placed inside the frame is a beauty.
It is request to the visitors, kindly don't write your names on the walls of the historical landmarks."
Historic but a poorly maintained place.
A majestic & charismatic place from history. The very essence of Lahore`s history.
History of MUGHUL EMPIRE..... great place to visit in lahore
"I love that place but i think it can be improved,like the services ,in other words can be done lots of things to attract more people as well as give them more deep touch of history in more enertaining way.Overall its a great place to visit which reflect the great history of Sub-continent."
Must take your children to this historical place
"The Lahore fort, also known as Shahi Qila, is a must-see place in Lahore for any tourist. It is one of the typical Mughal era monuments from the 17th century and has remained under the Sikhs and the East India Company during their rule, spreading over a vast area. The list of attractions also includes Shaesh mahal, Naulakha Pavilion, Shahburj, Kastab Khana, and the List is endless. They constructed a Gurdwara in the area during the regime of the Sikhs as well."
Whenever i went there i fall in love with this place..peaceful place but they just closed Sheesh MehAl and add extra ticket of Rs.100
The place was amazing to visit and a fun treat if you have a tour guide.
Its losing its beauty everyday and we re doing nothing about it.
Stunnung place for full day picnic and fun a lots of historical things ... Remains of mughal empaire.... I Always ready to go there . must visit for relax your mind .
"A very beautiful fort!
There's a ticket of 20 pkr for entry."
Went in there after a long time. So many memories. Rich history. Amazing atmosphere. Really enjoyed specially the weather was fantastic. Totally recommended. Best to go with some historical history in check. Very very big place. You need a full day to discover just a half of this ancient. Go and enjoy with your family.
Ancient fort that was defending city. Nice to see.
"The Lahore Fort (Punjabi and Urdu: ÿ¥ÿß€Å€å ŸÇŸÑÿπ€Å‚Äé, romanized: ShƒÅhƒ´ QilƒÅ, lit.‚Äâ'Royal Fort') is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.[1] The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares.[2] It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century,[3] when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendour and opulence.[4]"
An amazing historic place standing tall to display a glorified past of Muslim Rule in the Sub-continent. Visiting this place requires a good couple of hours. Each place within the fort takes you in through the trail of past events. A truly glorious place to go and visit. You may require an entry ticket to pass through the gate.
"Needs to be preserved and people should be given access to the main basement, good place for shooting and site seeing"
It was the first time i visited lahore and love all the architecture and soul of the city lies in it's beautiful history
Best place for a family day out.Hire guide for best experience
Awesome historic place to visit with family or without family
"Extremely badly managed, actually mismanaged historical place. It shows everything, what we may call the priorities of the Punjab government. It was painful to see, vanished areas which i noted a couple of decades ago. Unending shame to the authorities and the government of Punjab, who are earning from the historical place but is unable to protect and manage it. May Allah SWT give hadayat. Ameen"
Its a very cheerful place in the most historical places....
"A really nice day out. A lot of history, so definitely worth getting someone genuine to guide through the place. Do visit the Sheesh Mehal and if you can, get them to light fire to show the starry effect."
Unbelieveable fort everü§ó
Unexpected journey which gives goosebumps when you just watch the interior design and the hardwork‚ù£‚ù£‚ù§‚ù§ damn beautiful ‚ù§‚ù£üòç
Beautiful and great place to visit with friends.mist visit üòò
"What A Historical Place To visit. Heart Touching Views  , top touring spot."
best place for travellors and explorers.
Worth visiting. Needs proper maintenance and up gradations to attract tourists and visitors. Must add new attractions in line with international standards to keep this place attractive.
"Historical place, however I was disappointed because they didn't maintained it well."
"The sprawling ensemble of buildings that forms the Lahore fort could use a little bit more loving care. One of the external wall is being repaired, much of the mosaics are badly damaged, sadly as there are beautiful and sport small houses for the pigeons and the occasional parakeet. Some of the marble pavilions are similar to the ones in Delhi‚Äôs Red Fort. It is a lovely place and a must if visiting Lahore."
History and architecture are witty exploring with a guide.
Visited for the first time and guess what enjoyed every second of it.
Super it's Soo good and looking sooo lovely I love it
Nice place and drinking water not available
Great historical place
Excellent historical place really enjoyed
"Very awesome place..must visit this historical place. Measume is also located in the fort.  I will.suggest to visit it in morning or evening in summer because its too long and person can exhaust easily. Must take ur own drinking water as water.coller are not available. A restaurant is available at the fort but i didn't try it. One antique shop is also available and one can easy buy different things like sord , shield, knife, arrow , artificial jewelery, and different historical items that were used in wars in short artugral ghazi item's."
"I visited this place multiple time and found it very awesome, beautiful archetectural work, and lush green.
Lahore Fort is situated near The Greater Iqbal Park adjacent to Badshahi Mosque Lahore. So you can visit all these places at a time.
Fort is accessable from Lahore Railway Station, Lari Adda stand and Metro Bus.
Lahore Fort is a popular tourist distination because of it's beautiful landscapes and design and history. Bunches of people visit this historical place every day. There is a Sheesh Mehal that the king designed for her wife with other old time instruments which give awesome look to the tourists.
The Fort is very lush green with combination of walking trails and green lawns.
I would personally recommend this place to people of every age, gender and religion if they want to capture the old time archetural beauty. You just need to buy the entry ticket worth 50 PKR which is nothing for an attractive place like Lahore Fort."
"The best example of preserved historical grandeur is ‚ÄúShahi Qila‚Äù or ‚ÄúLahore Fort‚Äù. It is a true demonstration of the royal era of Mughals, Sikhs and colonial rulers. The interesting fact about Shahi Qila is that the builder of this mega structure is still unknown."
"Lahore Fort is one of the best place in Pakistan to visit, one should go there with a professional guide who knows the history."
Very entertaining for historical point of view
"Historical place . you can spent quality time with family, frnds and other person üòâüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç"
"Love to visit this place again and again, have memories of my childhood attached with it."
This is a very historic Fort. I have been here quite a few times. People can learn so many things about our history by looking at this ancient fort. A lot of people from foreign countries come over here so that they can enjoy the magnificent history of our country. There is even a small Museum in which many unique artifacts have been placed. This fort is part of our history and our heritage. Nowadays it is being renovated by the local Ministry of architecture. I look forward to visiting this fort again in my life.
"Historical significance and good cultural experience but horrible service from the caretakers and rude staff who are there to discourage people from enjoying the history.  They have short timings, especially in the winter, and close up the place for private events, from which they make significant amounts of money.  And I don't see this money spent back into the maintenance or improvement.  It doesn't feel like a ""public place"".  I don't like the management."
Well it.s now GREAT IQBAL PARK PART.and Fort entrenc from mide of of great IQBAL Park it's great Mughal time historical monument.feel different while visit of fort feel like Royalty everywhere specially she's mehal way from Elephant Step.must visit under of She's Mehal if get chance.and much visit museums.
Grate experience to go this place. Every body to there at least one time.üòöüòöüòö
"Needs more maintenance.lot of broken and in tapped / in covered area.
Only the grounds are well maintained.
The govt needs to take steps to preserve or else this will be a part of history in only.
You have to walk a lot so be prepared to park the car and walk a lot.
My rating is 5/10"
Still need maintainance....a lot of sites closed.....
"Never get tired of this place, grand courts, sheesh mahal, high walls, amazing architecture"
A historical monument of Mughal Dynasty in Pakistan..
A historical place depicting history of mughal empire
One of the best historical visit of Lahore
Historical place shish Mahal badshahi masjid etc
A beautiful piece of history. To see more of it in less time it is advisable to hire a local guide.
A very historical and trendy place ..
love this place proud to be historical inherit
Lahore fort is the part of greater Iqbal park. unfortunately fort is closed to general public due to mantainance.
Historical place to visit with family and friends by visiting this place we can a lot about our civilization.
"Very neat and clean and very well preserved historical place. But there is very high price of tickets, 50rs each person and another 100rs each for the visit of Shesh Mehal which is the part of this place but yet they charge it separately. Take my advice do not eat or drink from the canteen inside, too expensive and no quality what so ever."
Old and historial place and sign of mughal empire
Nice place for visiting specially in March
Awesome historical place
Absolutely amazing architecture. You can smell the history here.
I loved this place.It's simply a wonderful piece of architecture but the negligence from the govt made this place ruins of Mughal civilization
Great piece of art and mughal history
"Very disappointed. After 32 years visiting Pakistan. Tried to visit Lahore fort, and it was closed due to some vip protocol and was not let inside. It was not a good experience sadly under new government nothing changed same old morally socially culturally bankrupt government"
Anu and sahil is good and awesome place
One of historical site of Pakistan.
Amazing sight

"It is really nice, historical and memorable place."
"Remembering us the Era of Mughal Badshahs..... Lovely Peace,....."
Best historical place ever visted
Beautiful and historic place. Huge potential for tourism if this is restored properly. One of the most magestic forts I've visited so far. Take a guided tour as the sites within it are not well explained.
Good to see restoration of such historical place is underway
A great place to be... astonishing environment... a great memory of history...
It's the most beautiful and historical mosque I have ever vizited in my life.
ham ne aaj bohat enjoy kia with my all family members
Historic place. Great Mughal architecture see here.
Awesome Historical place.
Historical place full of beautiful views.‚ù§
"Excellent Place.
The best example of preserved historical bulidings is ‚ÄúShahi Qila‚Äù or ‚ÄúLahore Fort‚Äù. It is a true demonstration of the royal era of Mughals, Sikhs and colonial rulers. The interesting fact about Shahi Qila is that the builder of this mega structure is still unknown.
Wondering what is so special that has made this place an attraction spot for tourists? Well, the reason is its beautiful surroundings. Let‚Äôs make a tour of all the famous places in this post. So follow till the end.
The history of Shahi Qila goes back to 1550s at the time of emperor Akbar (1556-1605) to Aurangzeb (1658-1707). It is located in the North-West of the city that is spread 427 meters east-west and 335 meters north-south. The south-east area occupied Akbar‚Äôs court. The northern area is distributed into six compartments starting from Akbari Gate to Shish Mahal. In 1981 UNESCO enlisted Lahore Fort as World Heritage Sites.
The entrance gate of Shahi Qila is in front of Badshahi Mosque and is known as ‚ÄúAlamgiri Gate‚Äù. You have to pay a few pennies while entering this gate. It is made up of red bricks. While entering from the gate you can see the lavish garden with a cafeteria and parking."
its a beautifull place and there are many things from our islamic heros and there other related things like there roal rooms and much more
"Best place....
Monument historage."
Lahore fort worth watching
A worth visiting place.
Beautiful historical place to visit with friends and family
"Historical masterpiece of mughal architecture, loved it."
Lahore Fort Mughal Emperor Akbar  Built
Very beautiful and attractive place where you see Mughal empire a huge master piece. But peoples of Lahore throwing trash everywhere after leaving this historic place.
"Great place to go, beautiful and historic"
A beautiful pace to visit if you love historical places.
Loved the atmosphere. Cherished childhood memories when I first visited it about thirty years ago. Changed and improved a lot.
Historical Please & enjoying there üíûüíûüíû
Historical place... You just get lost in the past...
A great art of architecture by mughal Emporers in subcontinent...
Wonderfull historic place to visit old culture fort and tombs ..
"A must visit place if one has interest in history and architecture. I was simply amazed to see the kind of detailing and carving on stones on pillars, such details and synchronized patterns.
Well they won't let you inside the rooms and dungeons of the fort but it is simply because most of the locals don't take care of these historical sites and end up writing muhabbat namy and phone numbers on walls. Other than that it is an amazing historical site to visit if you visit Lahore. Be there early if you actually want to explore the fort as the closing time is 5pm."
A must visiting spot in Pakistan to review the mughal dynasty constructions.
"Historic fort , foreigner ticket entry is 500 and normal Pakistani is 50"
Amazing place. Good knowledge for Kids and whole family.
Old archeological site to visit in Pakistan.
"They have ruined this place , the government, the illiterate  tourists, the management. They must impose large ticket money  and fines for littering"
A very beautiful place to learn about Mogul and Sikh past...
Best Historical place in Lahore.
Maintenance and updation is required for this historical monument. We have very few historical monuments which need to be fully protected and maintained.
Its a 1566 historical place in the era of emperor Akbar. Its life giving to the history lover. Its one of my favourite place for outing with friends. its too big that we were unable to visit the whole fort due to the shortage of time. Seeing it just makes us think and imagine the lives of the people who used to live there. I had a class trip there and enjoyed alot.
Great place to visit and see the muslims history
Indeed a historical place worth visiting. You can easily feel the might of the great Muslim King and the details that Muslim architecture contains with ever standing structural quality. The museum is also very interesting to visit. The dominance of Sikh regime can be clearly seen. You can find govt. Registered guides who gives you proper information and interesting nerratives.
Historical place built at the time of mughal emperor Akbar.Some rennovation also taking place .The local guide we hired was very helpful and made our visit intresting.More facilities for visitors should be provided for visitors as restroom facilities were pathetic.

Great place for all visiting Lahore
"The place was simply amazing. But the public people have absolutely ruined it. They have written their names on CENTURIES OLD walls and simply have no respect for the architecture. These people should be fined heavily.

Other than that it was really fascinating to see everything. It's a good place to come to with your family."
"Such a historical place , great experience with such a amazing place"
lahore fort is awesome place to visit..
"Nice place to visit. If someone likes water in the middle of the icy mountain, this is the right place. Although food is not of quality as it should be and cleanliness of lake is also at stake but overall a fully family enjoyable place.

Great historical place.
Lahore fort is v amazing
"Oh, it's such a historical place. Visiting it reminds of the old era. One is forced to think of that old time, how the kings and other family members would roam in those antechambers, lobbies and yards. It's all structure is state of art. A great structure made by the Mughals!"
"A historical place that tells the stories of Mughal era. Architecture is unique, specially sheesh mahal is awesome. It was fun to go through the whole Fort. I will manage to visit again at some time."
Historical place with renovations and a good place for family outing
In a very bad shape. Repair works under way. Many places were closed. Photography is prohibited...dont know why? Many of the things were missing or stolen. Sheesh Mahal was closed too.
A great historical place but not taken care properly
A historical place.. Highly recommended for history lovers
Historic palace .....very informative & beautiful
"This place is not worth to roam around. You are going to see only walls with no information what it is. Boards are placed only about the area is called, but no information about what it used to be and for what purpose. Foreigner's have to pay 500rs to go in and roam like wanderers. You have to get a guide and pay for it who will tell stories, which ofcoursely one doesn't know that guide is telling true or not."
Fantastic piece of art and very great architecture
With new art work look more good...
"Have been there in my childhood in hot summers at least 20 years ago, this time the weather made us stayed for much longer this place speaks the royalty of rulers of that time every bit of it is royal the architect of the fort is mind blowing.

Recommendation for those who have not been here. Just ensure you choose the right weather if you really want to have great memories."
"Excellent sight seeing trip for kids..a great exposure towards ancient civilisation and culture.
Also mughal era architecture is a splendid thing to see..Good to see uniformed Chowkidars there who remind us the emperors of Mughal dynasty.
Another feature is the British army soldiers standing in a corner armed with guns as compared to Muslims who are armed with swords and other simple tools."
Beautiful historical place to visit.
It is a historical place located in lahore city of Pakistan. Lahore is capital of Punjab province. Shahi Qilla is a fort which was the residence of mughal emperorrs. It was constructed by Mughal Emperor Akbar on the bank of river ravi. Its a nice place to visit.
"History, History and guide's Story ;) but fun all the way"
Must Visit Place for people who like to know about history
"A very nice and well preserved historical place. More of an informational visit. Best if you could hire a guide available there.
I will suggest to look for Mr. Arif (most probably)   as a guide, he a young guy with glasses and lots of knowledge, very cooperative and knows etiquette."
Best palaces i have ever seen in lahore
"Visited Lahore Fort many times and always enjoyed tour of this magnificent historical place. Love the mysterious architecture of this fort specially its basements.
I enjoyed alot the event organized by Walled city Lahore authority in Royal Kitchen Area which recently preserved by them."
shows the amazing taste of mughals
Lahore fort is worth visiting with family and friends for a picnic or a day trip. Its best to go on working days instead of going on weekend when there are too many people . Also go in the afternoon so that you can experience a beautiful sunset . Light at that time is good for photography .
"It is historically very informative, interesting and good looking place. It gives understanding of Mughal rulers . Their living, their love with Architecture knowledge .
How structure is designed . How Engineers  make buildings with out having modern construction facilities . Beautiful Islamic atmosphere in building , in garden , in verandas, in roof decoration . Etc etc.
I can't explain fully . Must visit with family"
Mind blowing place full of history but shame little to no effort have been made to preserve it
Amazing place to know about history.
"Really interesting historically and for the architecture itself. Recently the whole place had a major uplift and the garden, parking, additional features have all become really nice. The only headache is the traffic around the area. The mosque, food street and old City around it all make this area much more interesting."
It was good experience. Nostalgic one. Very refreshing after visit. If u have a guide who can explain the history than joy will b doubled
Great historical place
Beautiful mystical magical place ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ wants me to go back in time and live in and experience what it was like that then...
It is a great place to visit.  Its a historical location in Pakistan for forners to visit
I love this place ‚ù§üíïthis place is my all time favourite üòç
Nice place to bring your family.
"One of the fantastic places to visit for 1st timers in Lahore. Historic place and tourist attraction. Neat and well maintained , recently public park is expanded which have increased its beauty. Good place for day out. Public toilets are too busy and not hygienic."
It is the heritage site and it's architecture is beautiful nothing has been changed. But they don't allow you tripod to take in I don't know why . Although it's the best historical place ‚ù§Ô∏è.
Very good historical place
"Had a good time. Best time to visit is either in March or September and October. Should take enough time to explore if you are really interested in history. Time required to tour would be at least 3 to 4 hours with a good guide.
Poorly maintained."
Awesome... After long time I visit Lahore Fort again. Great experience and recall the childhood memories. Punjab Government good work to preserved the Mughal's asset and our Punjab historical places. Awesome experience bus and  rickshaw service.
Mughal Empire which was destroyed by bloody british dogs with ruining education and culture of Golden Sparrow.
Fantastic. Needs serious maintenance work.
"Amazing Historically Place i have ever seen. When i visted that place i can feel how the Mughal Emperors live there or spend there whole day. The construction is amazing and i was surprised how can they built that fort in those days when there was no Technology.
If anyone has not visited the i strongly recommend you to get your car take necessary luggage and concur the Fort."
Excellent place our value heritage
"My experience was good at the lahore fort, but the management should work more on maintenance of the fort and on the clean environment of the fort, lots of people came and they threw garbage everywhere"
What a beautiful fort. Marvel of architecture. one cannot help but wonder what it would have been like back in the day when it was in full use. A must visit when visiting Lahore.
"Lahore Fort (Shahi Qila, Lahore). Although its an amazing place to visit but its been not looked after by previous governments. Another must see place in Lahore, another great example of Mughal architecture."
Awesome historical place in Lahore. Great structure of Mughal Government
Amazing place my Amazing Pakistan I love my country
"This is one of the best places I have ever visited and wish to travel again. The place is so historical you feel that you are actually in the 1600's. The bricks, the walls and the pathways all reflect the 400 year old architect. I dream of going to this place when I visit Pakistan Again. This is in my opinion the best tourist spot in Pakistan for people who like historical infrastructure."
"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Must visit place. There are gorgeous architectural masterpieces to see, as well as many things to learn. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization named the Lahore Fort and Shalamar Garden as a World Heritage Site ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"That is an amazing historical complex to go. It is a must visit. The historical building is full of mughal art and architecture. The admin is so cooperative. The facilities for tourists are good. Oh, just love that place.
We entered through Iqbal park , the entrance to qila and masjid are adjacent. If you go there you should visit them both. But be careful with your time becuase the entrance to qila after 5'o clock is rare."
Truly amazing and great experience. Place was busy with tourists and locals on the weekend.
"It's a great masterpiece of architecture, history and old civilization but poorly maintained by the authorities. The fort is slowly falling apart as the basements are full of garbage, most of the beautiful walls have been written onto and every corner of the building has been used as a toilet."
Good family day out  place
Is an amazing historical place with beautiful architecture and captivating scenery.
"Historic tour is really nice. However, to be able to get into the food street is a menace. Crowded, uncomfortable and constant pestering by locals clamouring to get some cash off visitors almost verges on harassment. The entry point needs to be better regulated."
A historical place i visited more than 5 times but still interesting to be visited. I recommend all the Explorers who have interest in ancient things must go there and see what things our eldres did. Especially the museum has lots of thing for those who are curious.
Fantastic place . Hidden history . Needs maintenance though
Oh what a great place to visit. I just wonder that there were no technologies and science at that time but Mughal‚Äôs mange to built such a beautiful building. This fort reminds us the great history of great Mughal era in sub continent. I still remember 2008 when I visited that place.
I love to see the historical place with kids field trip and rejoice my childhood memories again
Its very enjoyable place for all specially kids
"Amazing experience
Very vast area"
It was amazing so clean and informative
"It is a good place of old aged built style.
People still visit this for history research and it is actualy a place of prime importance for them"
"The Lahore Fort, also known as Shahi Qilla, is situated right in front of the Badshahi Mosque, which holds centuries of history. The place is a real treat if you are eager to learn about the history and admire the monuments which reflect the historical events from the past.

The Lahore Fort holds a great history back from the 11th century, and till the 17th century, it was appropriately built during the Mughal Empire. The fort remains partially restored after the British and Sikhs clashed.

The fort holds a vast area, including halls and gardens. The artistry of architecture can be found at various places around the enormous fort. It can take almost a whole day to admire and wander around the fort to witness its beauty.

The most visited place in Lahore fort is ‚ÄúSheesh Mahal,‚Äù 1400 feet by 1115 feet palace of mirrors built by Shah Jahan in the early 17th century. The site is decorated with beautiful tiles and reflecting mirrors, which genuinely seems like artwork on walls."
Definitely get a guided tour. Very knowledgeable staff. Wish they kept up the area a bit more. Shocked how close we were able to get to some of the paintings! Great experience and atmosphere.
It was gr8 n historical place
"It is truly a historic place. For me, it was more of thought provoking then enjoying because When you think of all the life people, the kings and queens used to have and then compare it to the now wrecked form you definitely question your life and luxuries at least for once. If you have visited it in the 2000's then just don't over fascinate it. It's nothing but buildings. And again be super selective when to visit because it's overly crowded on weekends and national holidays. And yes only good weather will make it a good visit."
"One Of The most amazing attractions of Lahore.
This is one of many historical sites, the beautiful city of Lahore has to offer to it's tourists.
It may take you a few hours to visit the place as in whole. But it is worth it.
If you're in town for a few days. This place is a must visit.
Hope you have a great time.

üôÇüëç"
Worth visiting this matchless piece of artistically made! U feel out of the world
"Amazing experience, plus, it is getting renovated. The prestige of Mughal era reflects in the artifacts. The scenery is amazing. Must see. But some people have engraved their names into the walls of this historical treasure. Which needs to be stopped."
"Its good historic place. its have great past in history of Subcontinent people. Its so amazing and that's time the creating of that's things is so interesting.
It is good and i like it."
Such a beautiful place to visit. Personally I like the shesh mahal. Such a nice trip wit my brother. Visit to Fort can feel you back to that time that there is no guns and you can beat your enemies throught all that time equipments. Such a lovely place to visit.
"Really a historic place in Lahore. Lahore Fort , commonly known in Urdu as ‚ÄúShahi Qila‚Äù (royal fort), was originally designed to protect the Northern-Western entrance to the walled, old city of Lahore in Pakistan. This is not a Lahore Fort essay, but a travelogue on my guided tour there.

Note: The ticket price for entrance in Shahi Qila is 50 Rs.

Best place for photography and best for family outings. You can see lot of  crowed, couples and kids. Really like this place."
The place is historic with aesthetic view. The mosque and fort are in front of each other and is a huge tourist attraction. The tomb of National poet Allama Iqbal is also there. Quran written with gold and silver on cloth is also there.
A very nice historic fort in Lahore city to be visited with full attention and a nice place to get familiar with Mughal empire and their building experience.this place is even good to be visited with family or friends.This fort can be visited on any day of the week.
"It's a historical place,best for a picnic and outing."
It was a worth visiting place .i enjoy going there again and again. Historical aspect is undeniable. But the work walled city authority and Aga khan culture trust is doing for preserving the fort is commendable.
"1. One of greatest historical site
2. Deducted one star due to poor management and cleanliness of place.
3. The place is a world heritage and neefs same level of care
4. The small museum made near cafe area needs lot of improvement."
"Lahore was named after Prince Luv, a son of Lord King Rama. I hope most of the Pakistanis at least know about it."
"Great historical place.. rich of culture and art remains.. 3 museums with Art Galary, Archery and Texual marvals add great value. Parking issues faced and saw bribary and preferrencial treatment first hand ... many sections which we used to visit easily a decade ago have now been closed as due to poor maintenance of heritage.

Tourism Department and Guide facility was new addition with electronic cart

Will Love to visit again."
Nice place... state of the art... but lack of management team. Need to review entry ticket and facilitation charges
"A nice place. It is being steadily improved. But still deserves a lot of improvement. If the old palaces would be renovated and recreated like they were 300 years ago, then it would be a place unlike any other in Pakistan."
"The Lahore Fort is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century,when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendour and opulence. The fort is located in the northern part of Lahore's old walled city. The fort's Alamgiri gate is part of an ensemble of buildings, which along with the Badshahi Mosque, Roshnai Gate, and Samadhi of Ranjit Singh, form a quadrangle around the Hazuri Bagh. The Minar-e-Pakistan and Iqbal Park are adjacent to the northern boundary of the fort."
Great place loved the historical advent there
"Historical Pakistan architecture. Great place to show kids doubting the the golden age of is Islam‚Äôs excellence. Very emotional place which astounds you by how this was done centuries ago without modern equipment. Personally, this also made me feel sad as it showed old Pakistan prospering and the modern one suffering with poverty and illiteracy."
"Lahore fort has its historical significance, but now, the place is more like a park or a place to visit for entertainment. The place is good for kids and adults alike, especially those having a affection for history. As of now, there is no parking ticket, but there are entrance tickets for some portions of the fort, like the sheesh mahal."
Lahore fort needs maintenance. Its condition is miserable. One of best spots In Lahore to visit.
"Lahore Fort also known as the Laal Qila, which was built maybe centuries ago. As soon as you enter the fort, you can see giant footsteps on the left side of the fort where the Mughals used to ride their elephants.

We hired a tour guide who said he could show us the whole Fort and explain the structural history on the way. Glad we hired a tour guide or else we would have been lost.

There are so many engineering marvels that you get to know. And can also see the Badshahi Masjid from the top.

SIMPLY WOW. LONG LIVE HISTORY!!!"
Amzing place. It's historic place after all so there is great stuff to see and learn about. I had the luck to see the under ground area. But if you don't get lucky the above areas are even more spectacular. Tour guide is recommended without it you may not get best experience.
Top of the one fort in pakistan
"Yes we enjoy it too much . Very attractive place but no drinking water cooler available for tourists. It is really shame full act for administration who charge Rs.40  per head ' And earns thousands of rupees per day but spends no penny for the welfare of tourists.
The administration demands approval letter from students from office somewhere on mall Road. Even that for keeping shoes u will need to pay 10 rupees in Badshahe Mosque  but no class of water available in mosque for drinking water .I have handed over cash security guard deployed at gate to buy some plastic glass for drinking water inside mosque."
I love to visit Lahore fort whenever I go to Lahore. It had been a residence of kings for years. Every brick has a history and walls of this fort had seen the glory of the kings had been living there. If you go Lahore and dont visit this fort then you are still miles away from real ancient historical glory.
Historical place but need urgent renovation
Big...  Enormous...  Other of the secret jewels of Pakistan....
"A great place of history and heritage. Very clean when compared to other historical sights in Pakistan. Moreover well managed and beautiful grounds with sight seeing arrangements.

Fully recommended"
"Well maintained, Greater Iqbal Park has given some respect and have added much needed  value to The Lahore Fort.
Sheesh Mahal has been renovated. Do visit it. Better to go in October onwards to fully enjoy the surroundings, avoiding the heat and humidity."
"Good place if you want to explore History. Under 1 covered area you can visit Forte, Badshahi mosque, temple and much more. Keep plenty of water and wear comfortable footwear."
"The fort was modified by Jehangir in 1618 and later damaged by the Sikhs and the British, although it has now been partially restored. Within it is a succession of stately palaces, halls and gardens built by Mughal emperors Akbar, Jehangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, comparable to and contemporary with the other great Mughal forts at Delhi and Agra in India. It's believed that the site conceals some of Lahore's most ancient remains.

The fort has an appealing 'abandoned' atmosphere (unless it's packed with visitors) and although it's not as elaborate as most of India's premier forts, it's still a fabulous place to simply wander around.

The fort is entered on its western side through the colossal Alamgiri Gate, built by Aurangzeb in 1674 as a private entrance to the royal quarters. It was large enough to allow several elephants carrying members of the royal household to enter at one time. The small Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) was built by Shah Jahan in 1644 for the private use of the ladies of the royal household and was restored to its original delicacy in 1904.

The Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) was built by Shah Jahan in 1631, with an upper balcony added by Akbar. It's where the emperor would make a daily public appearance, receive official visitors and review parades.

Khawabgarh-i-Jehangir (Jehangir's Sleeping Quarters), a pavilion on the north side of his quadrangle, now houses a small museum of Mughal antiquities. One charming story about Jehangir is that he had a chain suspended outside the fort, which anyone unable to obtain justice through the usual channels could pull. A bell would ring in his private chambers and the petition would receive his personal attention.

Moving west, another graceful pavilion, the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), was built by Shah Jahan for receiving guests.

The Shish Mahal (Palace of Mirrors), built by Shah Jahan in 1631, was closed for renovation at the time of research, but should be open by the time you read this. Decorated with glass mirrors set into the stucco interior, it was built for the empress and her court and installed with screens to conceal them from prying eyes. The walls were rebuilt in the Sikh period, but the original marble tracery screens and pietra dura (inlay work) are in remarkable condition. The view from here over the rest of the fort and Badshahi Mosque is rewarding.

Naulakha is the marble pavilion on the west side of the quadrangle, lavishly decorated with pietra dura - studded with tiny jewels in intricate floral motifs. It was erected in 1631 and its name, meaning nine lakh (900,000), refers either to the price to build it or the number of semiprecious stones used in its construction.

You can exit the fort from here, down the Hathi Paer (Elephant Path) and through Shah Burj Gate; if you do, look behind to see the fine painted tilework of the outer wall."
Lahore Fort is place of sha jahan King the place is middle of lahore city
"All good except following points.
1) You are not allowed to visit certain parts if you don't have a tour guide hired.
2) Riding bus which takes you from the entry point of the fort to different places inside the fort is not the worth of the fee charged."
"Exquisite well maintained, was glad to see Sheesh Mahal in such a good state after so many years. UNESCO has done a good job. The artwork is exquisite, the size of the place is immense. It's well preserved and walking through the place transports us an era of wealth and splendour. It has been a must see at all my visits to Lahore."
"A lovely historical place to visit, includes a museum showing weapons and artefacts of war. There are tour guides but be sure to barter a good price.
A definite visit.
Enjoyed"
"Must visit place. There are gorgeous architectural masterpieces to see, as well as many things to learn. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization named the Lahore Fort and Shalamar Garden as a World Heritage Site."
"Lahore fort, historical place in Lahore."
Lovely historical place
Its a historical place when you visit this place you get all those feeling of mughal empire but you need to hire a guide
"Peace, calmness, silence.. a feeling of fullness and emptyness at the same time. All this will happen at one place i.e. Lahore Fort. You will see the building/rooms which were used by great emperors once are now deserted and ruined. Their rooms, gardens, worship places all is now a tourist place. It will tell a lot about history of whole subcontinent. The visit of Lahore is of course, incomplete without going to this place."
Amazing historical place but seriously need preservation
"I last visited the Lahore fort more than 50 years ago. It was good to revisit it after such a long time. Some parts of the fort are in good condition, but by and large a lot needs to be done before it is brought to an acceptable level. Some restoration work is going on, but it is painfully slow. Many other 16th or 17th century buildings in the world are in much better condition than the Lahore fort. But still, it is worth a visit."
Lahore is a historical city of sub continent and Fort of Lahore is tremandous place for archeology lovers.
A gift from mughals and a world heritage site that a person who comes in the city cannot ignore to visit..! It captivates your attention and you start admiring the work which has been done by the people of that time..those big walls and stairs and the art work you will surely live to visit again.
"A splendid place to take insight from glorious history of Muslims. It has been renovated these days and it is pleasant to see that the heritage had ultimately been paid attention and actions for its sustainability have been initiated. Sheesh Mehel has been renovated and is open on entry of 100 Rs ticket.
On the whole this place is captivating if you enter with a spirit to feel the time of its dominance instead of merely a visit place."
"Historical land mark build by Mughal Empire Akbar in 1566, addition of luxury marble & floral design made by successor Shah Jahan and ""Almghiri Gate"" (faces toward Badshahi Mosque) by Aurangzeb."
"The beautiful and distinguished fort built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh ji, which have seen lots of bloodshed on its walls is now ruined by the so called islamic culture."
A place must to visit
Every beautiful historic fort. The only thing I would like to bring to attention is some of the areas have been closed now because people do not treat the architecture with respect. It‚Äôs sad that we have such beautiful heritage but we are not allowed to see certain areas. Specially sheesh mahal. Otherwise loved every bit of it.
It is simply wonderful and majestic
Historical place for families picnic
Awesome beautiful historical place here
Tremendous improvements since my last visit. The place has been restored and is much better organized. The weather was hot and fort by night seems a wonderful option. Highly recommended for anyone coming to visit Lahore
Try sat night tour from 730 to 930.
"Shahi qila is best place for our cultural heritage. Every Pakistani special punjabian should must visits because its located in Lahore so Atleast all over Punjab must visit
Very good experience here"
Full of history spanning hundreds of years. Well worth visiting but could do with structured tours and some notation on the various artifacts. But in addition need to market the history of Lahore far more adequately.
"Great Historical Artifacts as well as monuments, increasing the beauty and glory of majestic Fort along with Badshahi Masjid, Minar-e-Pakistan and Gurdawara. Behind the Fort there are things that will be amazing and full of adventure, commonly known as Walled City Lahore."
Very beautiful mugal Fortress in Lahore the cultural capital of Pakistan there is also a museum inside this fort
Historical place of Pakistan. A remembrance of Moghal Era. It is located in the heart of Lahore. It is a grand place to visit. Keeping in view tourist requirements eatable stalls are also located now outside and inside the fort. Guides are also available to guide the tourists. Rest rooms are also provided for visitors. A must place visit with children so that children can know about our history.
üëèüèªüëçüèªüòÑ
beautiful historical place
"It is state of the art building of ancient time.
Mughal empire ruled hindustan and used this fort for their residence and everything.
Love that place.
It reminds A golden period for Muslims."
Me and my friend had many sunbath in winters. Huge old historic building. Must go if you visit Lahore. WCLA has done a great job Winter season is best time to visit. Come with one dish by each family.
It reminds the memories of mughal emperors and their life style...best place to see the culture of mughals..
"Centuries have gone ,but the grandeaur is at it's place"
"The great historical and cultural place,where u can experience the luxurious lifestyle of the Mughal Emperor s along with the architect skills of The Muslim architecture s."
"Historically great place
Feel free for any information
00923216823488"
Amazing place with an equally fascinating history. Sadly parts have been robbed of their glory during the days of the Raj.
"It was a Great Place.. We had A Lot Of Fun..
So touchy ‚ù§üëå"
"The Lahore Fort is also known as Shahi Qila or Royal Fort. It is located in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Moreover, the attractive and separate culture of this place attracts tourist. Best time to explore the Fort is during daylight. Inside you don't have any refreshment stalls but you can always take your own drinks and snacks with you. It is such a beautiful historical place to visit for any history lover. The dominance of Sikh regime can be clearly seen here. The mystery of this fort is that feeling of fullness and emptiness will surround you at the same time. You will see the building/rooms which were used by great emperors once are now deserted and ruined. Basically, it is not recommended for children but ideal place for young kids who want to learn about our history. Highly recommend peaceful area. If you got a chance, must visit this fort in winter.
Furthermore, there is also small beautiful museum inside the Fort that worth-watching and visiting. It is such a calm and quiet place. Your Lahore trip is incomplete if you haven‚Äôt seen Shahi Qila. Must visit to see that what story it tells you about the history of Lahore Fort."
A great place to visit and photograph
"A historical place with lot of old cultural things to see. While touring the Lahore Fort you feel that how the hold rulers are fond of these kind of constructions with lot of hidden facts, like tunnels, etc."
In mid night Lahore Fort give a wonderful view like this
Historical Place and also famous for the prayer's
"The magnificent fort having a rich history of the Mughal Era, Sikh Era and British Raj.
A must visit place in Lahore.
But for history geeks, please avoid visiting on Sunday."
Nice place .able to visit
"Great place to explore history.
You will remind history of Mughal Rulers Era.
Some Construction work is going on to repair the place.
Parking is available nearby. Badshahi Mosque and Sikh Gurdwara is adjacent to Qila. Its quiet bulky traffic around."
Its a good place for family
i am in there and this o sum .i am feel brilliant to see .i advice person who read this to come and see the beauty of lahore fort
"Historical place
I love it"
"Though it's a historical place and pur national heritage, I was really sad to see the way it's being managed. I think the government should pay a proper attention. Most importantly the outer walls and the back side. The streets and the roads around it should be modified and proper information should be displaced where necessary."
"Beautiful place to visit again and again. Everytime, one explore a new perspective of the huge fort. Walled City of Lahore Authority WCLA should work hard on renovation and rehabilitation of the buildings according to its original plan. After renovation, only guided tours should be allowed in inside building to preserve the structure."
"The Lahore Fort (Punjabi and Urdu: ÿ¥ÿß€Å€å ŸÇŸÑÿπ€Å‚Äé: Shahi Qila, or ""Royal Fort"") is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century, when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendour and opulence.
Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia, the first record of a fortified structure at the site was in regard to an 11th-century mud-brick fort. The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs. Additions from the Shah Jahan period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs, while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors, Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned Badshahi Mosque.
The fort is located in the northern part of Lahore's old walled city. The fort's Alamgiri gate is part of an ensemble of buildings, which along with the Badshahi Mosque, Roshnai Gate, and Samadhi of Ranjit Singh, form a quadrangle around the Hazuri Bagh. The Minar-e-Pakistan and Iqbal Park are adjacent to the northern boundary of the fort."
"Amazing place to learn about the history of the subcontinent. Very informative for kids and adults alike, you shouldn‚Äôt visit if you dont have a taste for historical places or are old and cannot walk since it‚Äôs huge. Facility of a visitor bus is also available but it only take you to the entrance of the fort and still requires a walk to explore the whole fort. Can be tiring for older people.

In general a great experience to get a glance of the lifestyle of the mughal emperors."
"Still a lot preserved but most of the things are closed you can not go inside. This is not good, also nobody should take the guide from the front gate or near this building,  I wanted to see more as this is the only reason of my Lahore visit, but so much disappointment."
It is in shambles.. ongoing maintenance is slow.. sheesh mahal artwork has withered away after what had already been scratched off by our idiot public. But still worth a visit if you want to get an idea of its grandeur
"Best historical place to visit in Lahore, representing our culture and old ways that our rulers lived and ruled.
And beautiful architecture shows that thy had some skillful engineers and mind blowing taste in art"
"The great symbol of mughal empire,every time you visit you think its your first time..."
"The greatest historical place and one of the places which is part of world heritage, thousands of the local and international visitors come here daily, the fort was built by Miguel emperor and very popular place in Pakistan I like this place it is good for intraday tour,picnic etc"
One of the most historical masjid in Lahore Pakistan. If someone want to visit then avoid to go on weekend because there are so much visitors and families on weekend
Fort itself is not in a good condition but still you get to see how great it it would have been in its glory days. The directions and communications in the fort can improve a bit but it has been really improved since we last visited.
"Another fabulous glimpse into the history, though almost 4 centuries old but reminds us of about 3000 years old history of Lahore."
One of the places you should visit if you are an outsider coming to lahore. The badshahi mosque and minar e Pakistan is also right next to itm so its a 3 in 1 package for the people. And the old and new foodstreet is also nearby.
Wonderful Place. Do take a tour guide. Guides cost money but they are worth it. Try to visit early in the weekdays when its less crowded. And dont forget to visit Lahore Museum afterwards. Adds to the experience.
Lahore fort or shahi qila is very famous historical place in Lahore. It is great example of architecture work of Mughal time.its near to great badshahi mosque.some part of this fort was damaged with passage of time .which is renovated again to maintain the beauty of this fort.visited many time . Great place to visit with family and friends.
"Good place for childerns to visit, family place, historical place."
Beautiful monument of history
"Lahore fort is a place which Lahore visitors usually don't miss.  If u r planning to go to fort reach there in early timings.  You must have ample time to visit the whole fort,  if you really want to explore then it is a whole day activity.  If you are short of time you keep in mind it will still take 2-3 hours for the whole fort. There are few parts which are closed after 4 pm so reach there in first half."
"Built, damaged, demolished, rebuilt and restored several times before being given its current form by Emperor Akbar in 1566 (when he made Lahore his capital), the Lahore Fort is the star attraction of the Old City. Note that the museums here may close an hour or so before sunset."
Lahore Fort is our history we have to save it for our next generation so that when we transit to next life our children can remember us for saving our history not to destroy. Because we didn't make any new history for them to be proud of. I'm sorry but we are much lazy in making history.
"AlhamduLillah, its great asset for the nation, how to preserve and maintain them. It is our responsibility also to take care and visit such  along with our kids in order to educate them about our historic background. Its a great technical, well planned engineering of the time."
"the fort of Lahore city is located the heart of Lahore. historic place to see many types of historic things in these place so I am suggested to visit this place first time nice experience and good feeling there air is so smooth,environment clean,quite nature and peaceful place.it experience is so good."
Historical and memorable place to go.
Beautifull attraction in Pakistan and Lahore
"A great historical place .
""It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor¬†Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century,¬†when the¬†Mughal Empire¬†was at the height of its splendour and opulence."""
"I have been to this fort 10 time since i was born in  Lahore it was an easy excess for to visit such amazing place .
while my visit once can feel fort walls  telling  us story what happened  here how these old walls used to be clean .
Just imagine if we all go back to that time those Mughls where there
( AHHHHHHH :(  nothing last for ever
TO GOD WE BELONG & TO HIM SHALL WE RETURN"
"It was a great experience and the fort is just amazing, the architecture reflects the engineers hardwork who build this, every inch of this fortress shows the quality work they have done, each inch is calculated and built on purpose of showing the greatness of mughuls empire. The designs have faded, the mirror castle is damaged and stripped but the remains still give the feels of the their unique culture and tradition, Now Government is starting to preserve this heritage site and now have started to repair and restore this man made beauty. This is a must go place whenever you visit Lahore."
"My Dream place
Beautiful"
Lahore fort is a place which Lahore visitor's usually don't miss the place was simply amazing best visit place for families and school trip picnic party place is really amazing and historical for foroner if come from outside off Pakistan you must visit
Lots of history but needs attention to preserve history.. This is a good place to generate revenue but needs honest effort... I suggest that there should be private bid who can fix and restore the place and than generate revenue to recover and make some profit from visitors in this way the history is preserved and less headache for government.
Really a fun place to visit. Hopefully the restoration process goes smoothly and the grandeur of the buildings is restored as much as possible. Do hope that the restricted areas are opened as well and people learn not to desecrate historical buildings.
"Well well well... Where to begin... The great Mughal dynasty is reflected by every inch of this mesmerising fort. The architecture, decor, designs, wisdom, gardens, and Sikh parts... all of 'em make a complete package.
Must visit once in life."
well mqintained historical place.
No comparision of this place beautiful elegant and historical classic master piece
worth visiting historical place
Good place visit I'm more beautiful time this
"Great place to visit. Lahore is a historical city filled with landmarks .You can also say that Lahore carries a lot of figments from the past .Lahore has been the cultural and social hub for the subcontinent for centuries .Enumerable emperors set foot in this city and constructed a number of grandiloquent structures that still carry the weight of history. Lahore fort is one of the pillars of this rich legacy of this city.
The fort was originally built in 1544 AD by the Mughal Ruler Akbar the great and it was built on the ruins of an ancient mud fort which already existed since 1021 A.D. The fort is situated in the North West corner of the city, beside the Walled city and is rectangular in shape, it has 13 gates which were also built by Akbar, and the main gates are located along the middle of the eastern and western walls. The entrance is remarkable with twin domes which lead further to extensively decked courtyards and pavilions with water features, some with wall decorations of inlaid precious stones and painted designs, some of this eye catching decorations still exist even today. These courtyards are so huge in size that it allows many elephants carrying people from the royal family to enter simultaneously together, in fact there are a flight of stone stairs constructed especially for the elephants‚Äô parades.
The fort today is not like as it was when it was first built in 1566. This is because that every Mughal emperor that came along besides the Sikhs and the British colonizers further built a pavilion or a palace of wall to the fort. Jahangir, Shah Jehan and later Aurangzeb created their own changes by further constructing hugely secure walls to the structure. Akbar especially got the Hall of Commoners also known as the Diwan ‚Äì e- Aam constructed in the traditional Iranian style, it is built in all red sandstone which was imported from Rajistan, Shah Jehan was responsible for the construction of Diwan-e-Khas, from there you could see river Ravi, in the year of 1631 when Shah Jehan started the construction of Taj Mahal, he also constructed the Moti Masjid or the pearl Mosque and even his own bedroom. The Mughal emperor Jehangir he made extensions to the gardens and built the castle in the Jehangir‚Äôs Quadrangle.
The fort displays the exquisite life style of the Mughal emperors and is proof of Lahore‚Äôs beautiful history, it is a tourist attraction and one sight that no one would regret seeing."
Lahore fort is a historic building which tells many stories of Mughal Empire but I believe that the government can look after the building more efficiently. Many parts of the buildings are crumbling and losing their charm. People come from far off places for the sight seeing but there is no proper guest room or waiting lounge. Maintenance of the building should be made priority with more systematic organization of things going on there.
Amazing historical place to visit in lahore
Historical place and beautiful
Awesome and history rich place for outing with families.
"The main place to visit in Lahore for tourists.  Shesh Mahal is the main point here under the fort I.e. Shahi Qilla. It was built by gear Mughal emperors. The visit of Lahore may not be completed if you miss this point.  Its amazing. Really whenever I visit Lahore,  I must visit Shahi Qillah as I enjoyed every time there."
Best place to visit if u want to know about Mughal emperors history... Its hallmark regarding old history... Well maintained by govt of pakistan... Its located in walled city.. Wash room are available in good condition.. There is parking lot available... Urdu and English detail is available for international tourist.. Best place and destination for tourist.. Rehabilitation work is going on as well
"What a place. The grandeur, the mystique, and the history is all there. What else one can ask for..."
It's the wonder of the world 400old building with long tunnels up to 30O km away & 7 basement without pilers is the unique Architect of Mughal Era .
"The fort was modified by Jehangir in 1618 and later damaged by the Sikhs and the British, although it has now been partially restored.

There are three small museums on site (photography prohibited): the Armoury Gallery exhibits various arms including pistols, swords, daggers, spears and arrows; the Sikh Gallery predominantly houses rare oil paintings; and the Mughal Gallery includes among its exhibits old manuscripts, calligraphy, coins and miniature paintings, as well as an ivory miniature model of India's Taj Mahal."
It's a best historical place to know about mughal empire
We are enjoying with our cuzins and sweet nephew in this fort
"Yes, you should visit this place if you have interest in mughal history. However, be ready for disappointment as you can only see the fort from outside. All the rooms are locked, access to most of the areas has been blocked and there are no descriptions on any of the buildings (ample graffiti though) so you're forced to hire a guide who may or may not be telling the truth. The only room that you could go inside was the ""sheesh mahal"", there is now a ticket for it. To sum up, it's a long walk through a maze of old bricks."
"Depicts the great history of Muslim Reign in Subcontinent. Mughals ruled this country with great attitude.
The build great buildings which are now a landmark of their era and source of inspiration and learning for the Pakistan's and residents and visitors from all over the world."
"our historical departments should  work  more honestly, but its a worth watching. Fort is spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar.It was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1674"
"Lahore Fort is very renowned Historical place. Thousands national and international visitors come to see this. Very large fort it is.
Do go to see it."
"The Lahore Fort (Punjabi and Urdu: ÿ¥ÿß€Å€å ŸÇŸÑÿπ€Å‚Äé: Shahi Qila, or ""Royal Fort"") is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares.It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century,when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendour and opulence.
Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia,the first record of a fortified structure at the site was in regard to an 11th-century mud-brick fort.The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs. Additions from the Shah Jahan period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs, while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors, Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned Badshahi Mosque.
After the fall of the Mughal Empire, Lahore Fort was used as the residence of Emperor Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh Empire. The fort then passed to British colonialists after they annexed Punjab following their victory over the Sikhs at the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849. In 1981, the fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its ""outstanding repertoire"" of Mughal monuments dating from the era when the empire was at its artistic and aesthetic zenith.
Location
Lahore Fort is located across the Hazuri Bagh from the Badshahi Mosque (foreground).
The fort is located in the northern part of Lahore's old walled city.

Though the site is known to have been inhabited for millennia,the origins of Lahore Fort are obscure and traditionally based on various myths.
Delhi Sultanate
The first historical reference to a fort at the site is from the 11th century during the rule of Mahmud of Ghazni. The fort was made of mud, and was destroyed in 1241 by the Mongols during their invasion of Lahore.A new fort was constructed in 1267 at the site by Sultan Balban of the Turkic Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate.The re-built fort was destroyed in 1398 by the invading forces of Timur, only to be rebuilt by Mubarak Shah Sayyid in 1421,In the 1430s, the fort was occupied by Shaikh Ali of Kabul and remained under the control of the Pashtun sultans of the Lodi dynasty until Lahore was captured by the Mughal
Shah Jahan period
Shah Jahan's first contribution to the fort commenced in the year of his coronation, 1628, and continued until 1645.Shah Jahan first ordered the construction of the Diwan-i-Aam in the style of a Chehel Sotoun - a Persian style 40-pillar public audience hall.Though construction of the Shah Burj commenced under Jahangir, Shah Jahan was displeased with its design and appointed Asif Khan to oversee reconstruction.Shah Jahan's Shah Burj forms a quadrangle with the famous Sheesh Mahal, and Naulakha Pavilion. Both are attributed to Shah Jahan, although the Naulakha Pavilion may be a later addition possibly from the Sikh era.The white marble Moti Masjid, or Pearl Mosque, also dates from the Shah Jahan period."
"Historical places of Lahore are great to visit, and this is one of them, you can recall and imagine the lifestyle of old kings and rulers here, beside that it is also a very nice place for photoshoot...."
"That's really amazing. The old culture, old sculptures, Piture Wall, Shah Buj and Mostl Beautiful Shish Mahal. And I also appreciate the Construction Work of Aga Kahan Culture Services Pakistan."
Amazing historical places especially coming from Canada.
Awesome place for family picnic üß∫
Fantastic place to visit with family. Kids enjoyed alot
Neat and clean historical places to visit
A spectacular historic site with alot to see within. Sadly it has been severely neglected and very poorly kept. I believe that such a place should be well preserved for generations to come. I believe with a little care and attention it would look so much better than it is now. Overall it's a great place to visit and see and marvel at the creations from the mughal empire of old. Just really sad that it's been sorely neglected.
Our historic asset.  The tourists from all over the globe are welcome here.  Safe and lovely place.  Best time to visit is between october till march. Summers are hotter in Lahore.
"Fort is an outstanding relic of the Mughal's greatness. Take your own refreshments and if you're from the North America or Western Europe, summers get kinda hot, aware.

Go to the Shish Mahal, it's quite a spectacle. Be aware of certain guides, their history is not super accurate so respectfully ask where they heard something when they tell you any odd story."

One of the very big assets of muslim history is Lahore fort. A number of visitors visits it daily. It represents the muslim heritage and show how magnificently muslims were in arts and how beautifully they have designed their living places. It is under renovation now-a-days. But one must visit here to see the beauty of art prepares by mughals. You can imagine the life of emporers there. Its a best place for visit.

"Amazing experience

Must visit place in Lahore Old City. Perfect place for tourism!"
Such an amazing place to visit .. Beautifully built in the era of a Mughal Emperor.. Greatly represents the Muslim History. üíï
A great tourist spot. Clean and well managed. Many areas of the castle have been refurbished but the classic beauty remain.
This place is our asset but no law and order. No parking available. Everyone is just trying to rob. Otherwise very good historical place. We'll preserved.
"One of the most beautiful forts in Pakistan. The old Mughal heritage and a perfect picnic spot for families. Children can learn about Mughal era in this fort. You can also visit Greater Iqbal Park and Royale Mosque in same visit.
There are many different aspects of the fort that can fascinate you, so just go and see.."
A great historic site of Mughal Era. Punjab Government has started maintaining it now so it's a great place to visit with family. Requires a lot of time to see it completely.
"A great hotel at the Forte road food street, just in front of east-south entrance. Besides the taste of the food you can double your fun to have a dinner at roof top, a beautiful view of Badshahi Mosque (Masjid)."
Fantastic Historical place

Had an enlightened experience viewing in awe at the grandeur and expertise of the artesians of the mughal era. Taking a guide on board really helped as we got to know facts about history that we were otherwise unaware of. Fabulous experience for kids and adults alike !!
Its amazing! Definitely worth a visit! They provide a tour guide who gives a detailed history of the place along with refreshments and even a live kathak performance!
Excellent. It's beautiful go early as when we were there the temperature was rising about 43 degrees. Having see the Taj Mahal you can see the similar style of building. Well worth a visit
"It's a great historical place, needs to be kept under govt. protectection n maintenance has to be done regularly.

A family picnic point n walkthroughs with spectacular sites. Sheesh Mahal is beautiful & Moti Masjid takes us back in the era of Kings & Emperors."
A fantastic experience to visit this historic place.
"The great historical place of Mughal Era in the Asian Subcontinent.

It was an great place with historical architecture and design üòç"
"A fort with a history which have seen many empires and civilizations, I was walking in side without the stairs suddenly I was over 5 stories high in a garden helped me realize the mystery about the 7floors of  Babylon gardens I didn't even feel climbing that high absolutely a wonder would love to go there again."
"Lahore Fort, the face of Lahore City is a famous historical place and a attraction to so many tourists. Built by the Mughals is still much now in its original condition. Thanks to the restoration and rehabilitation work performed here its now the most famous tourist spot of Lahore City."
"The Fort of Lahore is located in the heart of the city. It was a great experience to dive into the history of Pakistan, but the fort should be better maintained, otherwise it will be worse in some some years. Also, weekends are very busy.."
Perfect üëå place for visiting
Old would always be ramain Gold.  Excellent place to visit with your family and friends. High quality architecture.   Government should take necessary steps to ensure its beauty and cleanness.
"The Lahore Fort is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. Its a very busy and beautiful visiting spot."
Hectic place on the way to Lahore Fort.
"It is a very good place to visit along with family. The WLCA has done a good job in maintaining it. The parking for greater Iqbal park,  minar e PAKISTAN, Lahore fort and badshahi masjid is same. There is a little distance to walk before entering the fort. The ticket price is very nominal. 50/ for adults and 30/ for children up-to 12 years.
The main places to visit inside the fort are
1-Dewan e aam.( The place where kings used to see and receive the public)
2-Dewan e khas.
3-ihata jehangiri. (They say it was the bedroom of Jahangir. They have converted it into a museum.)
4- shesh mahal.(built by shah jehan for mumtaz mahal. Good thing is it is open for public. However the entry ticket is 100/ per person, Which is little bit expensive. If anyone wants a guide, it should for this place.
5-the summer palace which is beneath the shesh mahal. For that you require a guide. He would take about 700/ to 1000/. However it is worth it. It is spooky though.
Overall Lahore fort is a must see sight for visiting."
Public Message: Please stop writing on the walls.
obviously one of the most famous places to visit in Lahore if you are a tourist reading this it is a must to highlight the history and importance of Mughal empire and how they developed architecture through the ages
Historical place to visit in Lahore
"#LahoreFort is Massive! Please ensure that you avoid the summer period in Lahore (May-Oct). Notice the gigantic entrances, the brickwork and stonework pavements made to ease the ""Elephants traffic""! What's more, visit the different chambers and do not forget to look up the high ceilings as it may have traditional art of ""Pitchicari"" (glass pieces in limestone) The tile work outside and the interiors inside, the Dewaan-e-Khas (chamber of nobles) and the Dean-e-Aam (chamber of ordinary) ...just go on exploring and discovering the remnants of the glorious past of the Mughal Dynasty! Allmaterial was imported from outside Hindustaan - from the places of best known materials.
Thanks"
Greater iqbal park is amazing. Every monument is easily accessible because of the new design. Food street is near. People can visit and eat great food of Lahore.
Beautiful place and a must for anyone visiting Lahore
Nice place for people interested in architecture and history. The smog in winters destroys the beauty of the fort. People still throw garbage on the grounds. Strict enforcement of garbage disposal law is needed.
Lahore Fort has a history of almost one thousand years. The recent construction is more than 600 years ago. This is a landmark of Lahore city and can be considered one of the best historical places of Mughal era in India. The Govt. keeps a special eye on its maintenance and sometimes official functions are held in there which is disliked by the history lovers widely. This fort is enormously bigger and tells you a complete story of the Indian Mughal Kingdom.
It was an amazing place showing the history of rule in Lahore and Dehli. It's best to visit the fort at early times so there aren't many people.
A great historical destination to visit on vacation or a college or school trip. It is an embodiment of the Mughal empire's art and architecture. In short it is a wonderful place.
"We went late in the evening so was getting closed, for thorough experience one must reach early in the morning or afternoon"
"Historic fort is one of the precious symbol of mughal dynasty and Government of Pakistan is continuously maintaining its beauty.
The number of tourists specially foreigners are increasing day by day which shows a peaceful image of Pakistan"
"Famous landmark of Lahore City,  it was built on 1566 by Mugals,  it's very beautiful fort was rebuilt in 17th century, it spreads out on 20 hectors northern side of walled city of Lahore,
Recently Govt of Punjab has installed statue of Maharajah Ranjeet Singh in Lahore Fort."
"Lahore is the capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab and is the country's 2nd largest city after Karachi, as well as the 26th largest city in the world. Lahore is one of Pakistan's wealthiest cities with an estimated GDP of $84 billion as of 2019"
"Beautiful architecture, monuments and artifacts. Most part is damaged due to negligence and carelessness but still a fascinating place to visit for a look at history and heritage of the region."
Showcases the artistic work of the Muhgal Empire. We visited during midday in the month of September. Best to see during late afternoon or when the weather is fine for you to enjoy leisure stroll in the fort
"I love be this place every time I come I do visit, however I wish the people treat this better, no littering would be great. This has great scenaries and kind of romantic environment"
It‚Äôs a best art piece to show mughul history. Located in front of Badshahi mosque is so big having secret gateways in case of wars & Janhangeir‚Äôs tomb is also located in it.
It's amazing to visit this historical place it's my best experience
I had very much enjoyed there
"I visit here almost 2 times in a month. Just can't get bored here.I will call it the greatest place on Earth as a sign of culture.
The fort looks just like as it's not so old just the same as it was built.
Great place for visitors nd spend time here.
The Sheesh Mehal is the best thing in it."
Lahore fort have visited. Ancient times good places I have seen after a long time and I am sure you will enjoy the time you spend with your family and friends at this place.
"Lahore Fort is a world heritage site, this is a place where you can spend hours by observing and appreciating the architecture and history... It still shows the powerful era of Mughals"
"A special place in Lahore, you must visit here."

It is one of amazing place in Lahore founded by Mughal empire long time ago. You can say it is a symbol of Lahore if you are a lover of historical building must visit.
Ancient Historical fort. Area wise too large.
"I loved it because I got to see the history of the subcontinent and of the mughal empire it was a great time I got to meet new people and I even made some new friends I just loved my trip to the fort and to badshah-E-mosque because I got to see my Prophet (P.B.U.H) footprints his clothes and his prayers rug I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw all of his stuff I even saw a piece of his beard I couldn't believe my eyes I loved my trip to Lahore I hope u will enjoy my review on Lahore fort and Badshah-E-Mosque
Thankyou‚ù§"
Too much crowdy. The one who keeps the shoes outside mosque is very rude. Inside mosque was a blissful breeze. There is a museum which has Golden Quran.
A beautiful fort of the ancient times and is located in the huge land that is in many acres. The rooms of the princesses are still present there and due to alot of years they are broken but they still beautify when being visited.
"Lahore fort is a historic place with an immense wealth of history, heritage, culture and myths all in one place.

While the Walled city takes you thousands of years back, Lahore fort dates back to 13th century while most of current architecture and buildings were constructed during 17th century. You have to visit tor believe me."
This Fort has definitely improved a lot... But a lot more can be done... Plz keep up the good work.
"For families and individuals, a very good place to enjoy"
"Lahore, Urdu LƒÅhawr, second largest city of Pakistan and the capital of Punjab province. It lies 811 miles (1,305 km) northeast of KarƒÅchi in the upper Indus plain on the RƒÅvi River, a tributary of the Indus.
Little is known of the history of the settlement prior to the Muslim period. Hindu legend attributes the founding of Lahore to Lava, or L≈çh, son of RƒÅma, for whom it is said to have been named L≈çhƒÅwar. The city of ‚ÄúLabokla‚Äù mentioned in Ptolemy‚Äôs 2nd-century Guide to Geography may have been Lahore.

The city has had a turbulent history. It was the capital of the Ghaznavid dynasty from 1163 to 1186. A Mongol army sacked Lahore in 1241. During the 14th century the city was repeatedly attacked by the Mongols until 1398, when it fell under the control of the Turkic conqueror Timur. In 1524 it was captured by the Mughal BƒÅbur‚Äôs troops. This marked the beginning of Lahore‚Äôs golden age under the Mughal dynasty, when the city was often the place of royal residence.
Lahore consists of an old city area flanked on the southeast by newer commercial, industrial, and residential areas that are in turn ringed by suburbs. The old city was at one time surrounded by a wall and a moat, but these structures have been replaced, except in the north, by parklands."
"Cultral heritage of Mughal era. Despite the neglect and irresponsible attitude of the visitors, it still stands magnificent and grandiose. Consists of courtyards, gardens, Queen's own small palace and guest houses, gardens and vast basement with hidden chambers and galleries. Surrounded by a huge wall on four sides, with Badshahi Mosque built by Emperor Aurangzeb nearby.
Guided tours are also available but many with their own twist of history and folklore for the thrill of visitors. Restoration work is in progress and much has to be done yet. Visitors should be allowed with more restrictions as despite signs of keeping away and warnings about littering the visitors simply choose to ignore all that, climb any wall they can, enter any gallery they are not allowed to and litter everywhere."
"Most charming and epic historical place you will find in Lahore. Makes you want to visit it again and again. One cannot cover it in a day.
This place need complete attention and a whole day or two for it has historical gems to find and places to photograph every step of the way. Special shout out to the authorities responsible for its restoration, maintenance, cleaning and providing guided tours. You guys are doing a great job.
And to the people who visit,  please donot litter. It was disappointing to find litter strewn mere feet away from numerous dust bins present.
Take care of our history. It is our pride &  recognition"
Lahore fort is a must visit attraction in Lahore if you want to see the cultural aspect of Lahore.  It is located next to the badshahi mosque and minar e pakistan. Guides and tour carts are available to take you around and explain the significance of each area.
"Place is really amazing and historical but one problem I faced was that some people civilian were literally charging people to show areas which is not open for public.
There should be equality."
"Feel amazing to visit walled city Lahore, and experience the environment and ambiance of old Lahore.

Lahore Fort visit was quite nice. Amazed to see the ancient mughal infrastructure and remainings."
Great Place of the Mugal Empire
Amazing historical place besides badshahi mosque. Old and link to Mughal culture and Thier life style. If you love history then must visit
An amazing art üòä will you see there
"One of the best place to chill and have an educational tour, a very good picnic spot. It truely shows us the history and glory of Muslim Rule in subcontinent."
"Built, damaged, demolished, rebuilt and restored several times before being given its current form by Emperor Akbar in 1566 (when he made Lahore his capital), the Lahore Fort is the star attraction of the Old City. Note that the museums here may close an hour or so before sunset.

The fort was modified by Jehangir in 1618 and later damaged by the Sikhs and the British, although it has now been partially restored. Within it is a succession of stately palaces, halls and gardens built by Mughal emperors Akbar, Jehangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, comparable to and contemporary with the other great Mughal forts at Delhi and Agra in India. It's believed that the site conceals some of Lahore's most ancient remains.

The fort has an appealing 'abandoned' atmosphere (unless it's packed with visitors) and although it's not as elaborate as most of India's premier forts, it's still a fabulous place to simply wander around.

The fort is entered on its western side through the colossal Alamgiri Gate, built by Aurangzeb in 1674 as a private entrance to the royal quarters. It was large enough to allow several elephants carrying members of the royal household to enter at one time. The small Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) was built by Shah Jahan in 1644 for the private use of the ladies of the royal household and was restored to its original delicacy in 1904.

The Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) was built by Shah Jahan in 1631, with an upper balcony added by Akbar. It's where the emperor would make a daily public appearance, receive official visitors and review parades.

Khawabgarh-i-Jehangir (Jehangir's Sleeping Quarters), a pavilion on the north side of his quadrangle, now houses a small museum of Mughal antiquities. One charming story about Jehangir is that he had a chain suspended outside the fort, which anyone unable to obtain justice through the usual channels could pull. A bell would ring in his private chambers and the petition would receive his personal attention.

Moving west, another graceful pavilion, the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), was built by Shah Jahan for receiving guests.

The Shish Mahal (Palace of Mirrors), built by Shah Jahan in 1631, was closed for renovation at the time of research, but should be open by the time you read this. Decorated with glass mirrors set into the stucco interior, it was built for the empress and her court and installed with screens to conceal them from prying eyes. The walls were rebuilt in the Sikh period, but the original marble tracery screens and pietra dura (inlay work) are in remarkable condition. The view from here over the rest of the fort and Badshahi Mosque is rewarding.

Naulakha is the marble pavilion on the west side of the quadrangle, lavishly decorated with pietra dura - studded with tiny jewels in intricate floral motifs. It was erected in 1631 and its name, meaning nine lakh (900,000), refers either to the price to build it or the number of semiprecious stones used in its construction.

You can exit the fort from here, down the Hathi Paer (Elephant Path) and through Shah Burj Gate; if you do, look behind to see the fine painted tilework of the outer wall.

There are three small museums on site (photography prohibited): the Armoury Gallery exhibits various arms including pistols, swords, daggers, spears and arrows; the Sikh Gallery predominantly houses rare oil paintings; and the Mughal Gallery includes among its exhibits old manuscripts, calligraphy, coins and miniature paintings, as well as an ivory miniature model of India's Taj Mahal."

"Lahore fort
Historical place"
"You must have visited the Lahore Fort a.k.a. Shahi Qila, but have you ever wondered what you visit is just the terrace of that fort and main champers of that fort are protected and not open for public. Stories of secret champers and basements of Lahore fort always fascinate. There do exist tunnels and torture cells beneath basements. Allow me to show you one such basements called summer palace, and in my next post I will you show you torture cells followed by a post on secret tunnels of Lahore Fort."
Its our heritage so we take pride in visiting. But does one take care of garbage? You eat you throw wherever you like! This ancient heritage is crying for some maintenance.
Its Shows The great Mughal Emperor... They ruled more than 200 years..!
Great place to visit but arrange a guide for yourself...go inside by car .. best timing Saturday evening....as you may go down and explore fully..car ride inside fort ticket is 90 PKR... dresses of mughal kings are given on 150 PKR for photos.
"Historical place, Renovation work in progress. Hopefully completion date is 31 December 2019.
Limited area is opened for tourists. Well maintained by archeology department. Cleanness satisfactory."
"The experience was good! Its was little bit foggy but i lover the food and place‚ù§Ô∏è everything was perfect!

"Place is a must visit, they have a car which can drop you off nearby for 90pkr. Interesting history here, only thing missing is a guide and some reparations. People are indecent and have written their names and phone numbers on numerous walls."
"This centuries old fort was rebuilt by Emperor Akbar. Built, damaged, demolished, rebuilt and restored several times before being given its current form by Emperor Akbar in 1566 (when he made Lahore his capital), the Lahore Fort is the star attraction of the Old City.

Wide green grass fields and frouts trees make it more beautiful . Baradari  and Shesheh  Mahal , weapons show room and Old toop Hana  are mostly visiting area ."
Beautiful Historical Lahore Fort
"Great place to make a visit. Quite a few worth visiting places around it. Ideal time to visit would be an early Sunday morning, staring from Iqbal park and taking a selfie with Minar-Pakistan, one can start exploring insides of Qila and then after making a visit to Badshahe Mosque one can hop in the Walled City and do some epic Nashta (Famous Das Kulcha's would go with the flavour)."
One of my favourite historic places. The government of Pynjab has made massive developments in areas near fort. DO VISIT
"Beautiful historic Fort built in Mughal Era. Dewan-i-Aam is the place where Mughal Emperors used to meet common people to listen their problems. Sheesh Mehel is also a beautiful building. If you wait till the evening, you can visit sheeh Mehel by giving some money to security guards and see how it works."
A very historic fort and a master piece of Mughalia Art work
"A fun place for everyone interested in the heritage of pakistan
Its being extensively repaired through a lot of efforts by the Punjab goverment and Norway
The whole Greater Iqbal Park area is pretty presentable now.
Parking is secure and carts are available for tours"
"A mesmerizing historical place,
Can't be captured in photos.
It's the feel you get when you think about the kings who lived here at that time.
Just eipc."
"The sublime beauty of this place is captivating. As one enters the main gate they're taken into the historical abyss of the Mughal Era. Built by the legendary Mughals this structure is still standing strong after centuries. This Fort has seen many wars and takeovers until the British arrived and took it over. The inside of the fort contains beautiful gardens as well as rooms, jails, wells and the beautiful Moti Masjid. The top of the fort offers a view of the newly renovated Greater Iqbal Park and the whole scenery is a treat to watch. This Fort is a UNESCO Heritage Site. Located next to it is the famous Badshahi Mosque, currently on of the biggest and most beautiful mosques in Pakistan. This place is a no-miss if you're travelling to Lahore. It is a food-heaven too."
Fabulous Picnic point and architecture
"It's an amazing place to visit.
Every body coming to Lahore must visit it.
It gives you a message that every empire has an end,  So rulers should not forget it"
"One of the best and biggest historical site to see in Pakistan. The fort itself is amazing to explore and shows the glory of Mughal Empire, but it is surrounded by other historical sites also like Badshahi Mosque, a Sikh temple and Minar-e-Pakistan. The fort is located in old town, which is also great to explore. Parking is easy to find and there are plenty of restaurants in the area. If you are visiting Lahore, then this should be on top of the list of places to see."
Beautiful monument. Gives you a great view of the lower part of the city. Some of the details engraved in the stones will remind you a bit of the Taj Mahal. It is a MUST DO
"Nice place
Follow me on Instagram
Moosa__shahzad"
One of be best tourist attractions in Lahore connected with Badshahi Mosque & Greater Iqbal Park (Minar e Pakistan).
Nice archaeological site
"One of the ancient building built by Mughals and restored to mark to thr date. It gives you the impact of what a royal and luxury life the mings used to live and how open and wide space they used to have.
The finest example of palace"
"Beautiful, located at the western end of the fort, the Alamgiri Gate is the entrance of the Lahore Fort. It was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1674. It has two semi-circular bastions where lotus petal design adorns its base. It opens to the Hazuri Bagh and faces the Badshahi Mosque. The gate is one of Lahore's most iconic monuments, and once featured on Pakistani currency."
Memorable Time Spent There With Jiggers
"i went there 4 days ago in the funeral of Allama Khadim Hussain Rizvi.
i offtenly go to fort with my friends & also with the family. so much enjoyable place to visit"
This is nice place to see in Lahore Pakistan
Lahore Fort is the proud of the city  lahore.. And it is very good place to visit and one of the best restaurants are their.. And for  food lovers Lahore Fort is the best place...
"So much to be done on this beautiful historical asset, cant understand why it is so difficult for Govt to revive such locations to attract more people.
visited this place after 10 years, lots of changes are done, Parking area is not that well planned to accommodate weekend rush.

Then there is about 20 mins walk from entrance of Iqbal park to fort, so now we cant directly reach infront of Fort door. But buggies are available in cost of 200-300 to take you to fort entrance, this is fun ride.

Tickets are easy to get but you you will be bombarded by local guides to help you show full Fort. Good for first time visitors. Golf cart is available to take you from ticket counter to near Fort area for about 500, doesn't worth paying this much to avoid 5 mins walk.

overall good experience spend almost half a day with tea party and snacks. There is a local canteen available as well.

Toilets were average but not that dirty but available on only one side of Fort, so you may have to walk a bit if you are on the main road side of Fort area."
"Great historical place,  it was with full of picture walls and art works when i visited it first time in 2004. Now in 2018, it seems artificial after repairing in some areas.  But still love to visit ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
You will have an splendid experience and surely it will made your day. You will have a lot to learn about life in old times.

1) Badshahi Mosque
2) Mughal Shahi Fort
3) Tomb of Dr Allama Muhammad Iqbal (R.A)
4) Minar E Pakistan
5) Dancing Fountains"
"Mind blowing engineering the place will just take you 500 years back when the Fort was built to imagine the life then.
A must visit place in Lahore. Government could have played much better role in maintenance & restoration of the fort but similar to all other departments the performance is just below average.
There is a portion called Summer Palace which is below Shish Mahal and only open for foreigners but you can try to visit it through a guide."

"ahore is the 2nd largest city of the country, it contains many historical places and Royal Fort or Shahi Qila is one of them. This fort is also known as the Lahore fort and Badshahi Qila (Royal Fort). It is a very large fort which covers a big area of 20 hectares. Who built this mega structure is still a mystery. It is another masterpiece of King Akbar (a Mughal King); he took a special interest in its up gradation. It got some purgation in the Sikh‚Äôs era and then in the British era. Its entrance gate is right in front of the Badshahi Mosque. This entry gate is known as Alamgiri gate. Few nominal amounts are charged to enter in this area. These charges differ from local and international visitors.

A path which is surrounded by the great walls leads you to this fort. In the year 1981 it got the status of world heritage area. Few other attractions of this fort are the Sheesh Mehal, Moti Masjid, Naulakha pavilion and Alamgiri gate. Solid bricks are used during its construction, the condition of those bricks are not very good now. When you completely enter in its premises you find a beautiful garden in front of you. Cafeteria and car parking at your right side while an old well at your left side.

Dewan-e-khas was the place where King Akbar treat wits its V.I.P friends and V.I.P public. Residence was also provided to those Royal guests. Court of the King was held in it."
Historic Fort in the Central City of Pakistan. A good place to visit for the visitor to get an understanding of the past special Mughal Era Architecture.

It is a beautiful and historical place...
"And it became one of my favorite places in Lahore.Amazingly constructed and a great historical place.Gives you memories of sub-continent and Mughul empire.
A must visit place.
Highly recommended."
Lahore port is one of the best location for family to visit because its 3 in one kind of location..menaar e pakistan plus badshahi masjid plus lahore port so its 3 for one journey to visit
"Totally runs now,what was a well preserved place, when I saw it in 1971.
Reflects the mentality and behavior of Pakistani people. Majority of places are cordoned off as unsafe. The buildings are a rubble and the paintwork has fainted. So so disappointed for the state it is in.  :("
"I stopped at the Rakaposhi View Point to have breakfast on my way out from Hunza. It's about an hours drive from Hunza. You can see the Rakaposhi peak mountain, a 7788 meter-high peak, which is the 27th highest mountain on Earth but considered one of the¬†most beautiful ones. The view from here is stunning as I sat here waiting for the breakfast. The cold water splasing from the melted glacier of the Rakaposhi Mountain falls into the Gilgit river. A number of shops are on both sides. The breakfast was fresh¬†and tasty. Bought trinkets and fridge magnets from the souvenir shop. It had a lot of variety . Since it was quite early the shopkeeper gave a good discount. Friends bought pouches caps and shawls."
History of relives here
"Mughal architect...remains thereof...
A guide generally is better than roaming alone... And yes there are certain mini museums hidden at various loci but going there requires access to certain imbeciles who demand Extra money!"
"An Historical place amzing art has been pasted on it's walls. Wonderfull place for spend vecations and make a picnic with family. Historical things are pasted in it's meuseum.

Lahore Fort is one of the oldest place in Lahore. It was built in Mughals era. It was attractive place in Lahore in the past but City failed to maintain in good condition. Very populated around Lahore Fort. I recommended for those who really wanted to explore Mughal history.
Very beautiful built and artistically creature
"Historical place to visit, we enjoyed each and every second there .. a person must visit at least once in a life, we saw also torcher camps that were sealed now, where in General Zia Era people were kept to torcher, popular prisoner was Comrade Jam Saqi who refused to be purchased by thr established."

"Historical place , residance of mughal empires, situated near great mosque ""Badshahi Masjid Lahore"", a beautiful place for outing visiting research , tourist should must visit this beautiful historical place"
"Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia, the first record of a fortified structure at the site was in regard to an 11th-century mud-brick fort. The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs. Additions from the¬†Shah Jahan¬†period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs, while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors,¬†Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned¬†Badshahi Mosque.

After the fall of the Mughal Empire, Lahore Fort was used as the residence of Emperor¬†Ranjit Singh, founder of the¬†Sikh Empire. The fort then passed to¬†British colonialists¬†after they annexed Punjab following their victory over the Sikhs at the¬†Battle of Gujrat¬†in February 1849. In 1981, the fort was inscribed as a¬†UNESCO¬†World Heritage Site¬†for its ""outstanding¬†repertoire"" of Mughal monuments dating from the era when the empire was at its artistic and aesthetic¬†zenith.

The first historical reference to a fort at the site is from the 11th century during the rule of¬†Mahmud of Ghazni. The fort was made of mud, and was destroyed in 1241 by the¬†Mongols¬†during their invasion of Lahore. A new fort was constructed in 1267 at the site by Sultan¬†Balban¬†of the Turkic¬†Mamluk dynasty¬†of the¬†Delhi Sultanate.¬†The re-built fort was destroyed in 1398 by the invading forces of¬†Timur, only to be rebuilt by¬†Mubarak Shah Sayyid¬†in 1421,¬†In the 1430s, the fort was occupied by Shaikh Ali of¬†Kabul.¬†and remained under the control of the¬†Pashtun¬†sultans of the¬†Lodi dynasty¬†until Lahore was captured by the Mughal Emperor¬†Babur¬†in 1526."
This is the biggest attraction throughout Pakistan. I'm one of the fondest person to visit there. I imagine that I'm roaming in the realm of the mughals dynasty.... Well I don't really want to be there.
"What a place that Mughals have constructed. The grandeur and the place reminds me of how the Mughals would have lived in there era. Inside the Lahore fort the Masjid which is named Moti Masjid is very famous for praying. It is said that if you prayed there and wish any thing would happen,  Allah would definitely make your wish come true. The procedure of prayer is written on the wall of the Mosque."
"The Lahore Fort, is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. A good place to visit."
"It is one of the most visited places in Lahore. Mughal era fort. Magnificent architecture. Rs 20 ticket is required for entry. Inside the fort ""Shish Mahal"" is the most visited site. Car parking of Greater Iqbal Park is used. Price of ticket for foreigners is Rs 500."
Nice historical place
"I with family and my sister family visited shahi qila,  it was good a couple of years ago,  but now its boring place to visit,
-   fake guides are wandering everywhere.
-  costly and low quality food is served there
-  drinking water is not available
-  no playing activities for kids
-  over all bad experience
You may not waste time inside qilla, the outside great iqbal park is far better to spend time with kids,  freshening parks and kids play area is best to spend time"
"Lahore fort is in best places that are save from history. It shows the grace and money of old cultural shahi families. This fort replicate the culture , mind , thought and architecture of that time. Must visit lahore fort."
Awesome historical plac
Heart of the city. Good fort. Can maintain in a better way. Should keep the water.Very beautiful visiting there. Architecture is very beautiful.
"The red fort has much to offer, with religious diversity and great sightseeing it's a must have experience when one is in lahore..."
"Highly disappointed to see how this heritage is in such a bad shape. The government must provide funds to restore it's structure. On top, one can feel fresh air."
Lahore fort is amazing place to visit from historic point of view. You can plan a full day picnic with your friends and family.
"Honestly,I'm not happy with fort situation,govt is paying not much attention,no care,Lal Fort is so much under care but Shahi fort is not,many places are near to collapse and no new construction to prevent it"
Historical place to visit. Art of construction is really a lesson even for today's modern world
Great place to see when visiting Lahore
The Mughal architecture is quite astonishing. However some sections of the fort are crumbling and are in dire need of renovation. I wish it was well kept and renovated to maintain its original glory.

Though the site is known to have been inhabited for millennia,[2]¬†the origins of Lahore Fort are obscure and traditionally based on various myths.[5]

Delhi SultanateEdit

The first historical reference to a fort at the site is from the 11th century during the rule of¬†Mahmud of Ghazni. The fort was made of mud, and was destroyed in 1241 by the¬†Mongols¬†during their invasion of Lahore.[6]¬†A new fort was constructed in 1267 at the site by Sultan¬†Balban¬†of the Turkic¬†Mamluk dynasty¬†of the¬†Delhi Sultanate.[7]¬†The re-built fort was destroyed in 1398 by the invading forces of¬†Timur, only to be rebuilt by¬†Mubarak Shah Sayyid¬†in 1421,[8]¬†In the 1430s, the fort was occupied by Shaikh Ali of¬†Kabul.[9]¬†and remained under the control of the¬†Pashtun¬†sultans of the¬†Lodi dynasty¬†until Lahore was captured by the Mughal Emperor¬†Babur¬†in 1526.

The¬†Naulakha Pavilion¬†is an iconic sight of the Lahore Fort built in 1633 during the Shah Jahan period that is made of prominent¬†white marble, and known for its distinctive¬†curvilinear roof. It cost around 900,000¬†rupees,[30]¬†an exorbitant amount at the time.[31]¬†The structure derives its name from the¬†Urdu¬†word for 900,000,¬†Naulakha.

The Naulakha pavilion served as a personal chamber and was located to the west of the¬†Sheesh Mahal, in the northern section of the fort. The pavilion served as inspiration for¬†Rudyard Kipling, who named his¬†Vermont¬†home¬†Naulakha¬†in honour of the pavilion.[32]

The structure was originally inlaid with¬†precious and semi-precious stones. It reflects a mixture of contemporary traditions at the time of its construction, with a sloping-roof based on a¬†Bengali¬†style, and a¬†baldachin¬†from Europe, which makes evident the imperial as well as religious function of the pavilion.[33]¬†The marble shades of the pavilion are capped with merlons to hide view from the grounds.[34]"

Amazing and mesmerising place.
Visit to Lahore Fort after many years. Same old memories. Glad to see more facilities for families. Transport a bit expensive for such short trip from the gate to Dewaan. Ticket must not exceed more than Rs. 30/ per head. Train also same. Watched children literature festival. Great work and good contribution by the organisers and participants. Enjoyed Sunday with family.
It was great to go there. If you want to go with your family you need little more energy to walk. Don't use trains they are too costly better to walk around.
"The Lahore Fort, locally referred to as the Shahi qila( Royal Fort), is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. It is located in the northwestern corner of the Walled City of Lahore in Iqbal Park, which is one of the largest urban parks in Pakistan. The trapezoidal composition is spread over 20 hectares. Origins of the fort extend far into antiquity but the existing base structure was built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar between 1556‚Äì1605."
Guides available. Just outside the entrance that can guide guests in various languages. Plus shuttle service is also available with affordable rates. Should avoid weekends and The Palace area which is one of the main attractions closes  during Maghrib time WHEREAS the entire fort closes after Aghrib
Such a Wonderful historical place. I was there along with my family. We took guide. Guide was really helpful i wish i could spend more time there but unfortunately time was short. I want to share one more and most important thing that there is one saint's darbar i really want to know about that darbar i asked from ppl there but the opinion was different some are saying its real data darbar some were saying we dont know so i am really confused about that. If anyone have confirmation please let me know.
"Reflect history of Mughal Empire over sub continent.this fort reflect the architecture potential of that time. Ravi river flows near this fort. But most of Muslim Emperor spend their time for women,wine and music. They did not care of their empire.beside this fort is Badshi masjid that is also master piece of the archietcture"
A Mughal era fort with around 300 year old relics. Surrounded by lush green gardens. Ideal for full day picnics. It is recommended to hire a proper tour guide thru fort management. Also worth seeing is attached Badshahi (Emporer's) Mosque carved with red granite stone.
"Historical Place. The dream full place, we can imagine the Mughlia Shahi emperor's ruling in sub continent of Asia.
Every place of this Fort showing the memories of past beautiful moments of Shahi families.
Must see once in a life."
Most beautiful and historical place most good experience on adopt this place.
Very nice place I visited with my friend Shahzad. Very crowded on Saturday as dozens of School/ College trips.  Aloo Tikki at the entrance was delicious. Close is Badshahi Mosque and Minar-e-Pakistan. Plenty of photo opportunities.
Historic place. Must visit and bring younger children to know about history of Kings of All India
Great place to visit for any foreigner coming to Pakistan. Can spend almost 1 full day to visit all monuments at one location.
"Restoration is under process for some parts, rest of the structure is nicely done, just had an issue with some guys sleeping in mosque otherwise it's worth visiting"
"A beautiful and historical landmark of Lahore built by Mughal empire...

"I love the fort of Lahore. Its a historical place of old lahore.
I visit lahore fort many times."
Visited after long time. Sad to see deterioration everywhere in this monumental building. However conservation work was seen at certain places!
"This is an old fort ans it was made by Mughal rulers of subcontinent before partition so many buildings are there like Sheesh Mahal, Shahi Hamam, Khawaab Ghah, Bara Dharee and so on."
Lahore's one of the best  historical place
"Lahore fort is a really historocal place. Use to be residence for king of india in 15th and 26th centuries. King Akbar, Jahangir and Shahjahan contributed in parts for building this msssive structure almost 500 years ago. Its amazimg walkin in streets of fort and in places where kings and wueens of this land use to live. Really educational and cultural asset for our nation these kind of buildings are. Overall it is maintained well by Punjab givernment. But more concrrn should be shown for these historical buildings all around the country."

"I love this historical place
Lahore Fort¬†also known as¬†Shahi Qila¬†is located in north-western corner of the historical city of Lahore. Though irregular in scheme the fort measures about 427 meters east-west and 335 meters north-south excluding the fortification wall added later during the Sikh rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1799 ‚Äì 1839 A.D).

The chequered history of the fort is a living witness of the zenith and nadir of the Mughals, the Sikhs and the colonial rulers. The art of the fort building is reflects a series of monuments from Emperor Akbar (ruled: 1556 ‚Äì 1605) to the Aurangzeb (ruled: 1658 ‚Äì 1707 ).

The court of Emperor Akbar occupies the south-east area of the fort but most of the building have been extinct and the Masti / Akbari is still facing the Maryam Zamani Mosque. The northern half of the fort with its architectural beauty is divided into six quadrangles; from Akbari Gate to Shish Mahal."
"Great historical place. Reminisce of our culture and history.
Pro tip: take lunch with yourself from home instead of buying from there."
"Worst ever experience, Came back after spending 1 hour searching for proper parking around the fort. Official fort parking is closed and vehicles are not allowed to enter the parking area. Lots of dust because of construction and very very long walk to reach the main fort entrance gate and literally no car parking. If you are still eager to visit then either park on lorry adda or minare Pakistan parking but at your own risk because both are far away and insecure.
My advice is not to visit if you have kids and family along with you."
"Lahore fort, or Shahi Qila, is a citadel in Lahore. It is a great attraction in Lahore. The construction of Lahore fort dates back to as far as the eleventh century, however, it has been rebuilt multiple times after that.

Emperor Akbar added architectural and artistic motifs on the fort that show both Muslims‚Äô and Hindus‚Äô designs. Then, Emperor Shah Jahan applied luxurious marbles in the fort whereas Emperor Aurangzeb built the famous Alamgiri Gate.

If you are visiting Lahore, this place should be in your list of best places to visit in Pakistan."
A Historic place fort build by mughals  Badsha a very big a vast  fort with full luxury  of that time his antique  art on the walls a  must visit place if you come lahore for visit
A landmark of mughal history in ruins and dilapidation. Restoration efforts have been slow in the past but Agha Khan Trust fund has taken over for the work of maintenance of this awestruck mass of architecture and it seems that their efforts wil follow a good trajectory
"Budget at least 4 hours if you go there, a lot of the fort is closed to public, gaurds are very rude, public graffiti pretty much on all walls due to gaurds not doing their jobs. Costume scammers everywhere. But other than that a great lesson of history. Try to go on a day other than the weekend when the place is jam packed

Take your food and bring your garbage back, and also dear Fatima from Faisalabad: no one cares that you came there nor that you are in love with your donkey, please stop writing all that on the walls. Thanks in advance."
"Lahore fort stands out prominently amongst the best accomplishments in the architectural history of South Asian Subcontinent.

Good historical place
"Dear visitors this place is the best and one of my selected place in Lahore. Often I come here and sit alone in any corner of the forte.  Thinking  about the past. The time when the emperors lived here, it is a succession of stately palaces, halls and gardens built by Mughal emperors¬†Akbar,¬†Jehangir,¬†Shah Jahan¬†and¬†Aurangzeb, comparable to and contemporary with the other great Mughal forts at Delhi and Agra Taj in India."

"The Lahore Fort is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century, when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendour and opulence.
The fort is located in the northern part of Lahore's old walled city. The fort's Alamgiri gate is part of an ensemble of buildings, which along with the Badshahi Mosque, Roshnai Gate, and Samadhi of Ranjit Singh, form a quadrangle around the Hazuri Bagh. The Minar-e-Pakistan and Iqbal Park are adjacent to the northern boundary of the fort.
Shah Jahan's first contribution to the fort commenced in the year of his coronation, 1628, and continued until 1645.[14] Shah Jahan first ordered the construction of the Diwan-i-Aam in the style of a Chehel Sotoun - a Persian style 40-pillar public audience hall.[14] Though construction of the Shah Burj commenced under Jahangir, Shah Jahan was displeased with its design and appointed Asif Khan to oversee reconstruction.[14] Shah Jahan's Shah Burj forms a quadrangle with the famous Sheesh Mahal, and Naulakha Pavilion. Both are attributed to Shah Jahan, although the Naulakha Pavilion may be a later addition possibly from the Sikh era.[14] The white marble Moti Masjid, or Pearl Mosque, also dates from the Shah Jahan period.
The fort is divided into two sections: first the administrative section, which is well connected with main entrances, and includes gardens and Diwan-e-Khas for royal audiences. The second, a private and concealed residential section is divided into courts in the north and accessible through elephant gate. It also contains Sheesh Mahal, spacious bedrooms and small gardens.[28] The exterior walls are decorated with blue Persian Kashi tiles. The original entrance faces the Maryam Zamani Mosque and the larger Alamgiri gate opens towards Hazuri Bagh through the majestic Badshahi mosque.[29] Influence of Hindu architecture is seen in the zoomorphic corbels.[2]"
Its nice place every body must go there
"Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia,the first record of a fortified structure at the site was in regard to an 11th-century mud-brick fort.The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs.¬†Additions from the¬†Shah Jahan¬†period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs,while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors,¬†Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned¬†Badshahi Mosque.

Admirable view best for nikkah and shooting ceremonies
It's an historical place. Guides and cars are available for tour. Small Cafe is also inside. For detailed visit 2 hours would be required.
It is such a wonderful place. People must visit this place to admire the work of people who contributed in building such a giant structure. They will know how the Kings used to live..
The secondary gates should also be opened for public there's only one gate ....
"Visited during summer peak in 2013. Heat roasted us and we could not enjoy much. Seasons other than summer are more suitable for going to Lahore. A guide helped us. Many guides present with reasonable fees. Fort is a grand monument. Badshahi mosque, Ranjeet Singh samadhi (only Sikhs allowed) & old red light area (now moved) are the noteworthy places nearby. Minar-e-Pakistan is at walking distance across the road. A must visit area of a must visit city Lahore, in Pakistan."
Excellent ace for outing and dining it's amazing asset of Pakistan and food Street is amazing. You can get all types of Pakistani food including Pakistani traditional and lots of intertainment along with live singing.
Beautiful place everyone must have visit
One of the best heritage site with museum in Lahore. Needed to be maintained as symbol of glorious past and  for tourism in the country.
"If you are a Lahori, you must have visited the Lahore Fort also known as Shahi Qila many times, but have you ever thought about the stories hidden inside the walls, bricks, doors, gardens, fountains, palaces and the dungeons? The fort is not about the buildings it has; it is a living history of the eras it has gone through and still reflects the love, atrocities, times of tranquility and upheavals which Lahore witnessed through this fort as it was always the most wanted seat for those who ruled Lahore. Lahore Fort was enlisted among the¬†world heritage sites¬†in 1981 by¬†UNESCO.

Now let us come to the insights of this reflection of many centuries. It cannot be said with certainty when the Lahore Fort was originally constructed or by whom, since this information is lost to history. However, evidence found in archaeological digs gives strong indications that it was built long before 1025 A.D¬†as we do see the temple of Loh inside the fort. The earliest reference to the fort comes in a history of Lahur (Lahore) compiled by Al-Biruni, which refers to its construction in early 11th century. Historic accounts say that in 1241 A.D. it was destroyed by Mongols, in 1267 A.D. it was rebuilt by Sultan Ghiyas ud din Balban, in 1398 A.D. it was again destroyed by Amir Tamir‚Äôs army, in 1421 A.D. Sultan Mubark Shah Syed rebuilt it in mud, in 1432 A.D. it was occupied by Shaikh Ali of Kabul who made repairs to the damages done by Shaikha Khokhar and then in 1566 A.D. came the Mughals and Akbar rebuilt the mud fort with solid brick masonry on its earlier foundations.

He extended the area of fort towards the river Ravi, which till 1849 A.D., used to flow along its fortification on the north. Lahore Fort measures about 427 meters east-west and 335 meters north-south excluding the fortification wall of Sikh era and is enclosed within a strong fortification wall, built in small burnt bricks aging to Akbar‚Äôs era. The fort was essentially a fortress palace, but it also, served as an abode for royal treasury, and a strong hold in the event of war."
"The fort was modified by Jehangir in 1618 and later damaged by the Sikhs and the British, although it has now been partially restored. Within it is a succession of stately palaces, halls and gardens built by Mughal emperors Akbar, Jehangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, comparable to and contemporary with the other great Mughal forts at Delhi and Agra in India. It's believed that the site conceals some of Lahore's most ancient remains.

The fort has an appealing 'abandoned' atmosphere (unless it's packed with visitors) and although it's not as elaborate as most of India's premier forts, it's still a fabulous place to simply wander around.

The fort is entered on its western side through the colossal Alamgiri Gate, built by Aurangzeb in 1674 as a private entrance to the royal quarters. It was large enough to allow several elephants carrying members of the royal household to enter at one time. The small Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) was built by Shah Jahan in 1644 for the private use of the ladies of the royal household and was restored to its original delicacy in 1904.

The Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) was built by Shah Jahan in 1631, with an upper balcony added by Akbar. It's where the emperor would make a daily public appearance, receive official visitors and review parades.

Khawabgarh-i-Jehangir (Jehangir's Sleeping Quarters), a pavilion on the north side of his quadrangle, now houses a small museum of Mughal antiquities. One charming story about Jehangir is that he had a chain suspended outside the fort, which anyone unable to obtain justice through the usual channels could pull. A bell would ring in his private chambers and the petition would receive his personal attention.

Moving west, another graceful pavilion, the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), was built by Shah Jahan for receiving guests.

The Shish Mahal (Palace of Mirrors), built by Shah Jahan in 1631, was closed for renovation at the time of research, but should be open by the time you read this. Decorated with glass mirrors set into the stucco interior, it was built for the empress and her court and installed with screens to conceal them from prying eyes. The walls were rebuilt in the Sikh period, but the original marble tracery screens and pietra dura (inlay work) are in remarkable condition. The view from here over the rest of the fort and Badshahi Mosque is rewarding.

Naulakha is the marble pavilion on the west side of the quadrangle, lavishly decorated with pietra dura - studded with tiny jewels in intricate floral motifs. It was erected in 1631 and its name, meaning nine lakh (900,000), refers either to the price to build it or the number of semiprecious stones used in its construction."
"Nice heritage. A place to must visit.
Present in the heart of Old Lahore with awesome flavour of food street around in the vicinity of Badshahi Masjid."
Wonderful historical place.
"It is my routine route to visit LAHORE fort. It is attractive for foreigners.
As we are basically dirty people. We liter every thing here and there and I donor like it."
Memorises great days of Muslim History. Government must preserve the assets and promote tourism culture for young generation to know about its historical value.
"The Lahore Fort is a marvelous symbol of all the glory of the Mughal Era. It was built initially during the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar in the 16th century, with further additions and modifications done during the times of emperors Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb. The fort house many iconic structures which offer us a glimpse into the Mughals‚Äô glorious past and their lifestyle. Of particular note are the Sheesh Mahal, Alamgiri Gate, Nawlakha Pavilion, Deewan-e-Khas and Deewan-e-Aam. The grounds of the fort are adjacent to the Badshahi Mosque. In fact, the mosque, the fort and the minaret-e-Pakistan ground share the same entrance, so it would be an extremely good idea to plan and visit all three in one trip. A must-see when visiting Lahore!"
"Such a beautiful place.
As a citizen of Pakistan ,we should have to visit historical places to known the power of muslim unity"
Historical place for all. Specially for visitors from all around the world
"Historical place of sub continent, aatraction of tourists.i love this place i learnt a lot from here, its big and amazing to know a royal life style of Mughal Empire. I suggest everyone to visit this place, especially tourists."
Impressive and majestic. This fort is the icon of Mughal empire and its grandeur will impress you to the core. Must visit place in Lahore.
"The place has so much history, and one can thoroughly enjoy the structure if u have some   interest in the mughal period. Ruled by muslim, Hindu and Sikh rulers, the forts architecture has gone through many changes in different periods. I was amazed that most of the characters from the movie Mughal e Azam actually lived here or built it! It's so big that u need a generous amount of time to completely walk through it all. Just needs more attention by the authorities for maintenance."

"What is the timing of the Lahore Fort and the Mosque these days? Please do let me know.
Thanks in Advance"
"The present design and structure of the fort traces its origins to 1575, when the Mughal Emperor Akbar occupied the site as a post to guard the northwest frontier of the empire. The strategic location of Lahore, between the Mughal territories and the strongholds of Kabul, Multan, and Kashmir necessitated the dismantling of the old mud-fort and fortification with solid brick masonry. Lofty palaces were built over time, along with lush gardens. Notable Akbar period structures included the Doulat Khana-e-Khas-o-Am, Jharoka-e-Darshan, and Akbari Gate. Many Akbari structures were modified or replaced by subsequent rulers."
"Lahore fort was designed and built by mughal emprors. It is added by UNESCO in their list for cultural sites located in the world. The fort is lovated on a wast area orotected by high and big walls and doors famous for their decoration and architecture. Dewan e khas, dewan e aam, Huzoori bagh and many other old buildings are the main points worth watching and attractive. A larg mumber of tourists vist the site on daily basis."

Amazing place
Fort is historical place and we should reserve it but it is totally detroyed now we thought that we came across some ruins. Thanks to agha khan uni they have started work on it
Worst experience. We cannot even take pictures of our historical places. All areas sealed. No one can enter into any chamber or room. Even we are not allowed to go underground. My suggestion is that they should now destroy historical places. F**king Govt. and their rules.

Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia,¬†the first record of a fortified structure at the site was in regard to an 11th-century mud-brick fort.¬†The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs.¬†Additions from the¬†Shah Jahan¬†period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs,while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors,¬†Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned¬†Badshahi Mosque.
And after the fall of the Mughal Empire, the Lahore Fort was used as the residence of¬†Ranjit Singh, founder of the¬†Sikh Empire. The fort then passed to¬†British colonialists¬†after they annexed Punjab following their victory over the Sikhs at the¬†Battle of Gujrat¬†in February 1849. In 1981, the fort was inscribed as a¬†UNESCO¬†World Heritage Site¬†for its ""outstanding¬†repertoire"" of Mughal monuments dating from the era when the empire was at its artistic and aesthetic¬†zenith.

The fort is located in the northern part of¬†Lahore's old walled city. The fort's Alamgiri gate is part of an ensemble of buildings, which along with the¬†Badshahi Mosque,¬†Roshnai Gate, and¬†Samadhi of Ranjit Singh, form a¬†quadrangle¬†around the¬†Hazuri Bagh. The¬†Minar-e-Pakistan¬†and¬†Iqbal Park¬†are adjacent to the northern boundary of the fort."
"Historical lahore fort, was constructed by Mughal Empires. This is unique beautiful design creations with pdrsian effects. This is a combination of kings living and defense of army. It is situated on elevated place on the bank of the river Ravi, which offers good defense to the system.
Air flow is managed with effect of
the burnalis theorem and convex concave mirrors are used for Shish Mahal(palace of mirrors).  Beauty, elegance, defense, artistic work, precious stone construction design are the perfect elements of the fort."
"I have visited this place .People of foreign countries also come here for visit of this place.I have enjoyed very much here.Its all about design is so nice.I met many foreign people in Shahi Qilla who were come for visit this place.It is very nice location for families,friends and lovers.I cannot forget my trip here in my whole life.It is a good product of nature for us.PAKISATN ZINDABAD .

Lahore fort is a great historical place to visit with friends and family members. And to know more about our old history.
This is good place for historical things lovers. Students are doing work there and full of enjoyment and we obtain knowledge about Muslim empowerment which was lost.
Beautiful and historical place
"It was such a bad experience at Lahore Fort. Environment was also not conducive. Hopefully, loopholes would be rectified in a true essence."
"Latest uptade is, main enterence is changed, ticket booth shifted to old exit place, now there is one way for enterence as well as for exit.
There is also a ticket for Sheesh Mahal which was free in the past.
Over all these changes are for the benifit for revenue.
The most important thing is there are visit rikshaws are available for visit on wheels."

Lahore Fort also known as Shahi Qila. It is one of the best place to visit with friends and family. I suggest to hire a good guide to make your visit memorable.
Pretty. Grand. Impressive (front gate only). Sheesh mehel is wrecked. Needs preservation. The ill-mannered locals litter everywhere and there's no authority checking. More food stalls with quality food are a dire need.
Shah fort is a famous Mughal era fort€î it's build number of time€î  it has Dewan e aam and khas€î it shesh Mohal is famous for his elegance€î Mughal king used to live here€î shahi fort has number of underground dark alleys€î Dangerous and political prisoners are kept here for punishment
Beautiful historical place..
Storical site very disorganized government officials and very dirty and destroyed storical Monument. People that work there forcefully ask for money from tourist that visit the location.
"Historical place it is a sequence of noble placaces halls and gardens and
Such beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Pretty generic place to visit, although this place does represent the history but pretty much all special places are ristricted and you can't access."
Excellent place. Travel bus facility is available. You need to pay them advance in order to utilize it. Recommended for children and historian
Best place to Visit...but I don't know why they spend too much money for Repair and maintenance as they just waste land...as it is in kilometres..so they should take a little and rest land should be used for other purposes like school..university etc..Thnx...building are just building..but education can build a nation...
"I am very shocked to read that "" This fort is constructed in 200 BC"" on the entrance of fort. but in our books we read this is mad by mughals. What is true I don't know but this fort is amazing"
Wow that was amazing place. I enjoyed there most. Mosque here is full of spiritual calmness. I loved that place. worth visiting
"Overally protected. Most of the areas are closed for vistors.. No entry to sheesh mahal but to pay a bit bribe can open up all the doors.
Regret visiting with my foreigner friend..
Local doesn't really appreciate.. Engraved their names on the wall and vandalized almost everything.."
"Amazing historical place. Must visit once in a life time. Although not maintained properly, it still reminds of mughal lifestyle."

If you want to see dancing fountains visit after Maghrib"
"Views were so good. But this place needs alot of construction. And many areas were closed. They should be opened for tourists. Specifically the uper portions of some buildings.
Otherwise it was so amazingggggg‚ù§Ô∏è"
Historical place.  Must visit .
The Lahore Fort is one of the beautiful places that the Mughal Emperor Akbar built. In the night it is too scary when we go inside it. Monsters live in the dark. That is why the security guards would not let us go inside. It is behind the Badshahi Mosque.
A place to visit again n again to see the glory of mughals

"A Must visit place.. An open manifestation of Mughul History and their wonderful era. Notable spots are Sheesh Mahal.. Bara darri.. Shah Jahan and Jahangeer's Qadrangle. But some ""Hidden Places"" (Sheesh Mahal and Basement) not open to general public can be accessed through guide.
Its better if you manage to get a guide. Guides can show you some places which are not generally open to public. But negotiate the cost. Rs.400 would be enough !"
5 stars for being a historical place.. But facilities available here are not upto international standards as foreign visitors also visit these historical places of Pakistan
"Love this place if I visit Lahore again i would spend a good few hours here, well looked after, they have a cart that takes you to the top defiantly a ride to take for the elderly and kids who don't what to walk alot."
"The Lahore Fort. Historical site.
Built by the Mughal emperor.
Grand. Intriguing.
Close by is the famous  ""Baadshaaee Masjid"" (The Emperor's Mosque) and the resting place of Alama Iqbal (one of the founder's of Pakistan). A must visit to this historical site whenever in Lahore."
Great experience. Weekends are very rushy normally. Driver should exactly where parking is. There is huge parking near minare pakistan. Park there and cross park yo reach fort.
Historical place but not well preserved by pakistani government
Oh great place. It's reminds us our glorious past. Government took care of it now. It's an our national asset. I am amazed after seeing this gignatic sample of old architecture.
"Lahore Fort also known as Shahi Qila is located in north-western corner of the historical city of Lahore. Though irregular in scheme the fort measures about 427 meters east-west and 335 meters north-south excluding the fortification wall added later during the Sikh rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1799 ‚Äì 1839 A.D).

The chequered history of the fort is a living witness of the zenith and nadir of the Mughals, the Sikhs and the colonial rulers. The art of the fort building is reflects a series of monuments from Emperor Akbar (ruled: 1556 ‚Äì 1605) to the Aurangzeb (ruled: 1658 ‚Äì 1707 ).

The court of Emperor Akbar occupies the south-east area of the fort but most of the building have been extinct and the Masti / Akbari is still facing the Maryam Zamani Mosque. The northern half of the fort with its architectural beauty is divided into six quadrangles; from Akbari Gate to Shish Mahal."
And u ll eventually go in the MughalEra of 18 17 century
Very nice
Great history loved it all about kings and queens of Asia. Very nice trip and the architecture was mind blowing.
"In the Walled city,  this site offer ypu a neighbour of many historic places like Minar e Pakistan,  Badshahi Mosque, Tomb of Iqbal and many others.  Dont forget to pay a visit to food street when you come Lahore"
"Bad managment. Very expensive for general visitors, almost all places are closed for general public, if anyone want to see them thry have to pay a havey amount. And there is no repaire and maintenance and all fort look like colapsed."
"Dating from the era of Mughal Emperor Akbar, this fort should not be missed if you are in Lahore. It was built in the 17th century.
Additions from the¬†Emperor Shah Jahan's¬†period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs, whilee the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors,¬†Aurangzeb , and faces the renowned¬†Badshahi Mosque.

Super heritage. Must visit place. Too large to walk. Mughal erra is worth loving and one should wish to go to that erra and feel. U must know history before visiting that place

Lahore fort is one of the best tourists attraction in old Lahore and it is world heritage site. The magnificent Alamgiri Gate of  Lahor fort was built by Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir in 1673.
Its awesome and historical status of Pakistan.
"Lahore Fort also known as Shahi Qila is located in north-western corner of the historical city of Lahore. Though irregular in scheme the fort measures about 427 meters east-west and 335 meters north-south excluding the fortification wall added later during the Sikh rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1799 ‚Äì 1839 A.D).

The court of Emperor Akbar occupies the south-east area of the fort but most of the building have been extinct and the Masti / Akbari is still facing the Maryam Zamani Mosque. The northern half of the fort with its architectural beauty is divided into six quadrangles; from Akbari Gate to Shish Mahal.

Lahore Fort and Shalamar Garden are enlisted as World Heritage Sites in 1981 by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). Presently the administrative control of Lahore fort and Shalamar Garden lies with Punjab Government, under Archaeology and Tourism Department of Punjab. A reasonable amount was allocated by Punjab Government in the year 2005-6, for the restoration and conservation of these two monuments.

Notable Buildings and Structures of Lahore Fort:
Akbari Gate / Eastern Gate
Akbari Gate / Masti Gate
Akbari Gate / Masti Gate

It was built by Emperor Akbar in about 1566 A.D. It was later on called the Masti a corruption of the word in local version Maseet (transformation in English: Mosque). The Empress of Akbar built a mosque outside this gate in 1614 A.D that still exists in good condition. The fort of Akbar‚Äôs time had two gates including Masti Gate. The other gate was later replaced by Alamgiri gate in 1673 A.D.

Alamgiri Gate
Build by Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir (ruled: 1658 ‚Äì 1707 A.D) in 1673 in the west of the fortification wall, it opens in the Hazoori Bagh (Hazoori Garden). It shows a military and pleasing blend of strength, grace and grandeur as well. It has two semi-circular bastions decorated with lotus petal designs at the base.

Diwan-e-Aam (Hall of Public Audience)
Diwan-e-Aam of Shahi Qila
Diwan-e-Aam of Shahi Qila (Lahore Fort)

Shah Jahan in his fourteenth year of his rule (year 1642 A.D) ordered to construct the hall of forty pillars and its construction was completed in under the supervision of Asif Khan (brother of Nur Jahan, the empress of Shah Jahan‚Äôs father, Jahangir). Diwan-e-Aam was collapsed when Sher Singh (son of Ranjit Singh) bombarded Lahore Fort by light guns fighting against Chand Kour the widow of Kharak Singh, the elder son of Ranjit Singh. The British rebuilt it after their occupation of the fort in 1849 A.D. The marble work in the state balcony in this area appears to  be the earliest structural existing at Lahore Fort."

"The¬†Lahore Fort is a¬†citadel¬†in the city of¬†Lahore,Punjab,¬†Pakistan.The fortress is located at the northern end of¬†walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20¬†hectares.¬†It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor¬†Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century,¬†when the¬†Mughal Empire¬†was at the height of its splendour and opulence.

Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia,¬†the first record of a fortified structure at the site was in regard to an 11th-century mud-brick fort.The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs.Additions from the¬†Shah Jahan¬†period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs,[while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors,¬†Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned¬†Badshahi Mosque.

And after the fall of the Mughal Empire, the Lahore Fort was used as the residence of¬†Ranjit Singh, founder of the¬†Sikh Empire. The fort then passed to¬†British colonialists¬†after they annexed Punjab following their victory over the Sikhs at the¬†Battle of Gujrat¬†in February 1849. In 1981, the fort was inscribed as a¬†UNESCO¬†World Heritage Site¬†for its ""outstanding¬†repertoire"" of Mughal monuments dating from the era when the empire was at its artistic and aesthetic¬†zenith."

Wow Shahi Qilla of Lahore is a exciting place i have visited so far. Just imagine the lives of those people who lived. The gallery of armory is well maintained now. If you just focus on the architecture and construction strategies you will get confused that without todays technology and equipment how those people made it possible. You visit Qilla and imagine those people you will enjoy alot

"Lahore Fort

Alamgiri Gate of Lahore Fort (Shahi Qila)

Lahore Fort¬†also known as¬†Shahi Qila¬†is located in north-western corner of the historical city of Lahore. Though irregular in scheme the fort measures about 427 meters east-west and 335 meters north-south excluding the fortification wall added later during the Sikh rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1799 ‚Äì 1839 A.D).

The chequered history of the fort is a living witness of the zenith and nadir of the Mughals, the Sikhs and the colonial rulers. The art of the fort building is reflects a series of monuments from Emperor Akbar (ruled: 1556 ‚Äì 1605) to the Aurangzeb (ruled: 1658 ‚Äì 1707 ).

The court of Emperor Akbar occupies the south-east area of the fort but most of the building have been extinct and the Masti / Akbari is still facing the Maryam Zamani Mosque. The northern half of the fort with its architectural beauty is divided into six quadrangles; from Akbari Gate to Shish Mahal.

Lahore Fort and Shalamar Garden are enlisted as¬†World Heritage Sites¬†in 1981 by¬†UNESCO¬†(United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). Presently the administrative control of Lahore fort and Shalamar Garden lies with Punjab Government, under Archaeology and Tourism Department of Punjab. A reasonable amount was allocated by Punjab Government in the year 2005-6, for the restoration and conservation of these two monuments."
Amazing really enjoyed in lahore lot of availability speedo orange line badshahi mosque meinaei pakistan
"Again, the place is awesome however we have lost it. Some people are asking for money if you want to see the sheesh mehal. What's wrong with them. They have no official order to collect money and they don't let you go if you refuse to pay!"
Beautifull and historical place.

"Didnt find this place as interesting as people told me if would be. The best part was the nice view to the surroundings around the fort, and the nice garden outside that was a good place to relax from the busy city life."
Very very very bad expirence. There is no parking near the lahore fort. Provide the parking almost 2km from the gate of lahore fort. Only vip and the persons who knows the staff members can go inside with their car.
"Emperor Akbar Built in 1566 (when he made Lahore his capital), the Lahore Fort is the star attraction of the Old City.
The fort was modified by Jehangir in 1618 and later damaged by the Sikhs and the British, although it has now been partially restored. Within it is a succession of stately palaces, halls and gardens built by Mughal emperors Akbar, Jehangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, comparable to and contemporary with the other great Mughal forts at Delhi and Agra in India. It's believed that the site conceals some of Lahore's most ancient remains."

"The Walled City of Lahore, also known as Old City, forms the historic core of Lahore, Pakistan. The city was established around 1000 CE in the western half of the Walled City, which was fortified by a mud wall during the medieval era. The Walled City was bestowed with numerous monuments during the Mughal era, with some of Lahore‚Äôs most iconic structures being located in the Walled City, such as the lavishly decorated Wazir Khan Mosque, the massive Badshahi Mosque, and the Shahi Hammam. üëç"

"A great historical places, both the fort and mosque remind us the super power Mughals were. A great and woundering construction."
Lahore Fort (or as natives call it Shahi Qila which literally means Royal Fort) is a must watch. It's a big tourist attractions which equally attracts locals. I had been there plenty of times and everytime its a different experience. Try visiting it in different seasons (like summer or winter) and you will get a different flavor each time.

Wonderful place to explore history. But try to visit in summer. Not in winter as now adays very hot and humid. Picnic point.
the night view of fort is kinda spooky
It situated in greater iqbal park and bad shahi mosque most beautiful fort in lahore andmade in mughal era nyc place visit it
Great visit to this historical place. Beware of the tour guides that charge a lot and give a truncated tour. Read up on the Fort before visit and avoid the tour guides.
Happy to see they are maintaining at least one of the famous historical place
One of best historical place not only in Pakistan but entire world.  Would definitely recommend
Surroundings have been tremendously renovated now you'll find greenery around the fort and fort itself looks much clean..
It is historical place built by jahangir near River Ravi.Badshahi mosque is also situated near it which was built by Aurang Zeb Alamein another mughal emporer.
Gud one..
"Lots of history but needs attention to preserve history.. This is a good place to generate revenue but needs honest effort... I suggest that there should be private bid who can fix and restore the place and than generate revenue to recover and make some profit from visitors in this way the history is preserved and less headache for government.
Such a great palace

One of Historical Landmark of Lahore still showing off the state of Art & Architect over more than three centuries
Too much crowded on Weekend and Sunday. So better to visit on weekdays. Also 100 PKR ticket for sheesh mehal is unfair.
Very historical place this is. If you wanna see some very awesome construction pieces than visit there.
It's a great historical place but I think a lot more requires to be done to keep it in proper shape and form to attract more tourism.
"It was beautiful piece of Art,
But currently didn't managed well ....
Poor condition, poor maintainence by Government of Punjab & Government of Pakistan.
They destroyed the heritage"
"A place full of  history. A historical place in the heat of lahore. This place is good for family trip or trip with friends or kids school trip a place to know about history.
A place for picnic."
"I visited this place in the evening. Its very wide and open, we got tired of walking and could not enjoy the whole place. They do have shutles there but it is very hard to find there pick up point."
Historical place good for photography
This is an historic place of Mughal era. Well maintained by Govt. Of Punjab.
"A historical place........ üòç
Just love it...... But the management is not good..... The government should work on it....... Some restoration ‚öí work should be done....... Its a great memory of great mughal empire......."
Its a wonderful historical palce

"No words to describe,  history shows itself"
Ys good varaity of all gold and silver
"The Fort is an instantly recognisable tourist sight and an unforgettable experience for its sheer size and majestic views over the Walled City of Lahore. As impressive as the Fort is, it lacks in conventional tourist facilities, such as clean toilets or a decent cafeteria, and, despite visible attempts at restoration, is in a state of considerable disrepair and wilfull vandalism (mostly by graffiti). The crowds of mostly Pakistani tourists affirm its iconic status to the city and Pakistan itself. Highly recommended!"
